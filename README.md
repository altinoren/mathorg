# About

The Math Olympiad Organization Project is an open-source repository of problems collected from USA Math Olympiad Summer Program handouts (with permissions from the owners) past IMO Shortlists, and past USAMO's, started by [Alex Zhu](http://alexzhu.me). It differs from other resources in a number of ways: 
* It's prepopulated with a huge number of problems, organized by topic. 
* Solutions are sorted by upvotes and downvotes, are always hidden at first, can show hints, and can be commented on. ([Screenshot 1](http://i.snag.gy/I6QGQ.jpg), [Screenshot 2](http://i.snag.gy/dWixF.jpg))
* Users can mark problems as favorites, problems they're working on, and problems they've solved, and access these problems ([Screenshot](http://i.snag.gy/ktZwr.jpg))
* Users can search for problems by keywords, source, topic, difficulty, and elegance. ([Screenshot 1](http://i.snag.gy/TVZyo.jpg), [Screenshot 2](http://i.snag.gy/Ay9S1.jpg))
