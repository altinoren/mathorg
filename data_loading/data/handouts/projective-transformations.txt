In modern formulations of geometry, the projective space often
plays a central role. These notes are to some extent about
transformations of one particular projective space, $\mathbb{R} \mathbb{P}^2$,
but are really about the way these transformations can tell us
something about geometry in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the plane. Historically, the
idea of projection was developed in the Renaissance by
mathematicians and artists in order to accurately represent the
way three-dimensional scenes are projected onto the cornea. We
start with a classical description of a projective transformation.

[h2]Parallel Projection[/h2]

A [b]parallel projection[/b] is a map between two planes $S$ and
$T$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$. One chooses a direction $\hat{n}$ not parallel to
either plane and maps a point $A$ on $S$ to a point $A'$ on $T$
such that line $AA'$ is parallel to $\hat{n}$.

This transformation is familiar to anyone who has looked closely
at a sun shadow. Rays of light from the sun are effectively
parallel, so the parallelogram shadow cast by a rectangular wall
is its image under a parallel projection. This example
demonstrates several important properties of parallel projection.

[ul][li]Parallel projection takes lines to lines and points to points.
If three points are collinear or three
lines concurrent before parallel projection, their images will
remain so.[/li]
  [li]Parallel projection takes parallel lines to parallel lines.[/li]
  [li]Parallel projection does [i]not[/i] preserve angles.[/li][/ul]

Several other properties are not as obvious from our example but
are nonetheless true, as we shall see.

[ul][li]Parallel projection preserves ratios on a single line. That
is, if $A,B$, and $C$ are collinear, then $AB/BC =  A'B'/B'C'$.
This is not true if the points are not collinear.[/li]
  [li]Parallel projection takes ellipses to other ellipses. However,
circles are not taken to circles, except by trivial parallel
projections.[/li]
  [li]Parallel projection takes parabolas to parabolas and hyperbolas to hyperbolas.[/li][/ul]

One technical note before we move on: We defined parallel
projection as between two distinct planes, but it's nicer to think
of it as a map from the plane to itself. To make our definition
fit, we have to map the figure back from the image plane to the
preimage plane. We can do this by any similarity. The group generated by all parallel transformation is called the
group of [b]affine transformations[/b]. Note that this group includes all similarities of
the plane. It is the group generated by linear transformations of the plane and translations.

[h2]Central Projection[/h2]

A [b]central projection[/b] is a map between two planes $S$ and
$T$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ given by choosing a point $P$ not on either plane and mapping a point $A$ on $S$ to the intersection of the line $PA$ and $T$.

[ul][li]Central projection takes lines to lines and points to points and preserves colinearity and concurrence.[/li]
  [li]Central projection does not preserve parallelism or angles.[/li]
  [li]Central projection preserves cross ratios between four collinear points or four concurrent lines.[/li]
  [li]Central projection preserves conics.[/li][/ul]

Central projections generate the group of projective transformations of the plane. Central projections do not, in general, preserve the line at infinity.

  [li]{{{Show that if three triangles are perspective from a point, then their three lines of perspective concur.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Suppose that inside of a triangle $ABC$, we have three mutually tangent circles $\omega_A, \omega_B, \omega_C$ that are each tangent to sides of the triangle. Let $\omega_B$ and$\omega_C$ be tangent at $A'$, and define $B'$ and $C'$ similarly. Show that $AA', BB', CC'$ concur.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Here is an interesting proof of Brianchon's and Pascal's theorems. Let $ABCDEF$ be a circumscribed hexagon, and let $PQRSTU$ be the inscribed hexagon such that $A'B'$ is tangent to $P$, etc. Move $A, B, C, D,  E, F$ alternately up and down out of the plane. Then $A, B, D, E$ are coplanar, so $AD$ and $BE$ must intersect. Thus $AD, BE, CF$ are skew lines that pairwise intersect, hence they must have a common intersection. Moreover, let $AB$ and $DE$ intersect at $L$, $BC$ and $EF$ intersect at $M$, and $CD$ and $FA$ intersect at $N$. Then $L, M, P, Q, B$ are coplanar, as are $L, M, S, T, E$. Thus $PQ$ and $ST$ both intersect the line $LM$. Hence the Pascal line of $PQRSTU$ is the intersection of the original plane and the plane $LMN$.}}}[/li]
