Divisibility relations are ubiquitous in number theory, and knowing how to approach them is essential to having a strong foundation in number theory. Because of the wide range of contexts in which divisibility relations appear, the set of techniques with which to approach divisibility problems is very broad. This handout will cover a handful of these techniques---namely, [b]bounding[/b], [b]considering prime factors[/b], and [b]performing algebraic manipulations[/b]. The best way to improve at each of these techniques is simply by doing practice problems. 

[h2]Techniques[/h2]

[h3]Bounding[/h3]

Suppose that $a$ and $b$ are integers, and that $a$ divides $b$. Then either $b = 0$, or $|b| \geq |a|$. In many cases, knowing that $|b| \geq |a|$ is not immediately helpful. However, there are a few tricks that can make the bound more useful. For example, when $a$ divides $b$, we know that $a$ must also divide $b$ minus any multiple of $a$. The bound can often be more helpful when applied to such a difference. As another example, suppose that $b$ factors into a product $cd$, and that it can be deduced that $a$ divides one of $c$ or $d$. Then the bound provides more information when applied to $c$ or $d$, because $c$ and $d$ are smaller than $b$. 

[b]Example 1.[/b] Find all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2 + 1$ divides $n^3 + 3n + 1$. 

[b]Solution.[/b] Since $n^2 + 1$ divides $n^3 + 3n + 1$, it must also divide $n^3 + 3n + 1 - n(n^2 + 1) = 2n + 1$. Since $n^2 + 1$ and $2n + 1$ are both positive, we must have $n^2 + 1 \leq 2n + 1$, so $n \leq 2$. Testing $n=1$ and $n=2$, we find that $n=2$ is the only solution. 

[b]Example 2.[/b] Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Show that if $a + b$ is prime and divides $ab + 1$, then one of $a$ or $b$ must be 1. 

[b]Solution.[/b] If $a+b$ divides $ab + 1$, it divides $ab + 1 + a + b = (a+1)(b+1)$. Since $a+b$ is prime and divides $(a+1)(b+1)$, it must divide $a+1$ or $b+1$, whence $a+b \leq a+1$ or $a+b \leq b+1$. It follows that one of $a$ or $b$ must be 1. 

[h3]Prime Factors[/h3]

If an integer $a$ divides an integer $b$, then each prime factor of $a$ divides $b$. Furthermore, $a$ divides $b$ if and only if the exponent of each prime dividing $a$ is at most the exponent of that prime in $b$. 

[b]Example 3.[/b] Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be positive integers. Show that $\frac{(a+b+c)!}{a! b! c!}$ is an integer. 

[b]Solution.[/b] Let $p$ be any prime number. To show that $a! b! c!$ divides $(a+b+c)!$, it suffices to show that the sum of the exponents of $p$ dividing $a! b! c!$ is at most the exponent of $p$ dividing $a+b+c$ for each $p$. For any $n$, the exponent of $p$ dividing $n!$ is $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \lfloor \frac{n}{p^k} \rfloor.$ Thus, it is enough to show that 
\[ \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left \lfloor \frac{a+b+c}{p^k} \right \rfloor \geq \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \left \lfloor \frac{a}{p^k} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{b}{p^k} \right \rfloor + \left \lfloor \frac{c}{p^k} \right \rfloor. \]
To prove this, it suffices to prove that $\lfloor x + y + z \rfloor \geq \lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor + \lfloor z \rfloor$ for any real $x,y,z$, since we can then take $x = a/p^k, y = b/p^k, c/p^k$ and sum over all $k$. But 
\[ \lfloor x + y + z \rfloor = \lfloor \lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor + \lfloor z \rfloor + \{ x \} + \{y \} + \{z\} \rfloor = \lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor + \lfloor z \rfloor + \lfloor \{x \} + \{y\} + \{z\} \rfloor \geq \lfloor x \rfloor + \lfloor y \rfloor + \lfloor z \rfloor, \]
so we are done. 

[b]Example 4.[/b] Let $n$ be a positive integer. Show that if $n \mid 2^n - 1$, then $n = 1$. 

[b]Solution.[/b] Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is some $n > 1$ such that $n \mid 2^n - 1$. Let $p$ be the smallest prime divisor of $n$. Note that $p \mid 2^n - 1$, and that $p \mid 2^{p-1} - 1$ by Fermat's little theorem. Thus, $p \mid 2^{\gcd(n, p-1)} - 1$. But since $p$ is the smallest prime factor of $n$, and all prime factors of $p-1$ are smaller than $p$, we have that $\gcd(n, p - 1) = 1$. Thus, $p \mid 2^1 - 1 = 1$, which is a contradiction. 

[h3]Algebraic Manipulations[/h3]

Many divisibility problems become more tractable when the expressions in the problem are manipulated, e.g., when some terms are factored or rearranged. 

[b]Example 5.[/b] Show that if $n$ is a positive integer and $2^n + 1$ is prime, then $n$ must be a power of 2. 

[b]Solution.[/b] Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $n$ is not a power of 2. Then $n$ can be written in the form $2^k m$ for some odd integer $m$. Since $m$ is odd, $a + 1$ divides $a^m + 1$ for each positive integer $a$. In particular, for $a = 2^k$, we get that $2^k + 1$ divides $2^n + 1$, so $2^n + 1$ cannot be prime, which is a contradiction. 

[b]Example 6.[/b] Show that for every natural number $n$, the product 
\[ \left( 4 - \frac{2}{1} \right) \left(4 - \frac{2}{2} \right) \cdots \left(4 - \frac{2}{n} \right) \]
is an integer. 

[b]Solution.[/b] The product simplifies as follows: 
\[ \prod_{i=1}^n \left( \frac{2(2i - 1)}{i} \right) = (2n-1)(2n-3) \cdots (3)(1) \cdot \frac{2^n}{n!}  = \frac{(2n)!}{(2n)(2n-2) \cdots (2)} \cdot \frac{2^n}{n!} = \frac{(2n)!}{n! n!} = \binom{2n}{n}, \]
which is an integer.
