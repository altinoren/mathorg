Title: Pigeonhole

The pigeonhole principle says

-   If $n+1$ pigeons are put into $n$ holes then some hole has
    at least 2 pigeons.

-   If you put $kn+1$ pigeons into $n$ holes, then some hole has
    at least $k+1$ pigeons.

Pigeonhole can even be applied when there are an infinite number of
pigeons! If you put an infinite number of pigeons in a finite number of
holes, then some hole has an infinite number of pigeons.

Pigeonhole may seem very simple, but it can be extremely useful and can
be used in many interesting ways. Sometimes it is very clear what the
“pigeons” and “holes” should be. Other times one will have to be
creative and come up with the proper “pigeons” and “holes”.

Problems
========

1.  [[[
    Consider that we have a $5\times 5$ board. In each square, there
    is a flea. At the same time all the fleas jump and move to a square
    which is adjacent to their current square. Is it possible that after
    they jump that all the squares have one flea on them?

    If every pair of people are acquaintances or are strangers. Show
    that in any group of 6 people that there are 3 who all know each
    other or 3 who are all strangers.

3.  [[[
    (Handshake Problem) At a party, everyone shakes hands with some
    other people at the party (possibly 0 people). Show that there are 2
    people at the party who had the same number of handshakes.

6.  [[[
    If $n+1$ numbers are selected from the set
    $\{1,2,\dots 2n\}$ show that there are two of them such that one
    divides the other.

7.  [[[
    Let $n$ be odd and $\pi$ a permutation of
    $\{1,2,\dots, n\}$. Prove that
    \[(1+\pi(1))(2+\pi(2))\dots(n+\pi(n))\] is even.

8.  [[[
    Given two disks, one smaller than the other. Each disk is divided
    into 200 congruent sectors. In the larger disk 100 sectors are
    chosen arbitrarily and painted red; the other 100 sectors are
    painted blue. In the smaller disk each sector is painted either red
    or blue with no stipulation on the number of red and blue sectors.
    The smaller disk is placed on the larger disk so that the centers
    and sectors coincide. Show that it is possible to align the two
    disks so that the number of sectors of the smaller disk whose color
    matches the corresponding sector of the larger disk is at least 100.
