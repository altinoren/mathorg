Pell’s equation is a tool that comes up quite often in olympiad-type
diophantine equations. The equation itself is simple: we let $D$ be
a positive squarefree integer, and we look for solutions in positive
integers $(x,y)$ to
\[x^2 - Dy^2 = 1\qquad \textrm{(Pell's equation)}.\] We will discuss
variants below, but for now we consider this example alone.

There is a general solution to Pell’s equation, but it is
*implicit* in the sense that there is no closed-form expression for
$(x,y)$, only a method for calculating same involving a single
formula. There is a theorem that solutions to Pell’s equation exist;
therefore let $(x_1,y_1)$ be the solution with the smallest
$x$-value (indeed, we can find this one by expanding $\sqrt D$
in a continued fraction and take $x_1/y_1$ to be the first rational
approximation that gives a solution). The theorem states that all
solutions to Pell’s equation can be enumerated $(x_n,y_n)$, where
\[x_n + y_n\sqrt D = \left( x_1+y_1\sqrt D\right)^n.\] For example, to find
solutions to \[x^2 - 3y^2 = 1,\] we notice that $(2,1)$ is a
solution, and then the second solution is
$(2+\sqrt 3)^2 = 7+4\sqrt 3$, i.e. $(7,4)$, the third
$(2+\sqrt 3)^3 = 26+15\sqrt 3$, or $(26,15)$, and so on. 

There are a few variants to Pell’s equation, but the method of
producing solutions is usually similar. A good example is
$x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$, which we consider in the exercises. Note that
*existence* in these cases is no longer guaranteed in general, but if
solutions exist they fall into families similar to that for the ordinary
Pell’s equations.
