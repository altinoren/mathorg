[h2]Key Facts[/h2] 
 
[ol]
  [li]An inversion maps a line passing through the center of inversion to itself.[/li]
  [li]An inversion maps a line not passing through the center of inversion to a circle passing through the center of inversion.[/li]
  [li]An inversion maps a circle passing through the center of inversion to a line.[/li]
  [li]An inversion maps a circle not passing through the center of inversion to a circle not passing through the center of inversion.[/li]
  [li]If $O, A, B$ are non-collinear points in a plane, and $A'$ and $B'$ are the images of $A$ and $B$ under an inversion centered at $O$ of radius $r$, we have \[ OA' = \frac{r^2}{OA}, OB' = \frac{r^2}{OB}, A'B' = \frac{r^2 \cdot AB}{OA \cdot OB}, \]
  and $\triangle OAB \sim \triangle OB'A'$ (and, in particular, $\angle OAB = \angle OB'A'$).[/li]

[h2]Common Techniques[/h2]

[ol]
  [li][b]Inverting circles:[/b] When many circles pass through a single point, inversion about that point maps the circles to lines, which are often easier to work with.[/li]
  [li][b]Utilizing angle conditions:[/b] Bizarre angle conditions (e.g., involving out-of-the-way angles or sums of unrelated angles) often become much more tractable after an inversion.[/li]
  [li][b]Partial inversion:[/b] Sometimes, it can be helpful to invert part of a diagram and compare the image of the inversion with the original diagram, rather than inverting the whole diagram at once.[/li]

[ol]
  [li]{{{$ABC$ is a triangle with incenter $I$, orthocenter $H$, circumcenter $O$, and circumcircle $\Gamma$. Let $AH$ meet $BC$ at $D$ and let $AI$ meet $\Gamma$ at $M$. An inversion about $A$ with arbitrary radius maps $B$ and $C$ to $B'$ and $C'$, respectively. Identify the images of $I$, $O$, $BC$, $\Gamma$, $D$, and $M$ under this inversion with respect to triangle $AB'C'$.}}}[/li]
