Key Facts
=========

1.  An inversion maps a line passing through the center of inversion to
    itself.

2.  An inversion maps a line not passing through the center of inversion
    to a circle passing through the center of inversion.

3.  An inversion maps a circle passing through the center of inversion
    to a line.

4.  An inversion maps a circle not passing through the center of
    inversion to a circle not passing through the center of inversion.

5.  If $O, A, B$ are non-collinear points in a plane, and $A'$
    and $B'$ are the images of $A$ and $B$ under an
    inversion centered at $O$ of radius $r$, we have
    \[OA' = \frac{r^2}{OA}, OB' = \frac{r^2}{OB}, A'B' = \frac{r^2 \cdot AB}{OA \cdot OB},\]
    and $\triangle OAB \sim \triangle OB'A'$ (and, in particular,
    $\angle OAB = \angle OB'A'$).

Common Techniques
=================

1.  **Inverting circles:** When many circles pass through a single
    point, inversion about that point maps the circles to lines, which
    are often easier to work with.

2.  **Utilizing angle conditions:** Bizarre angle conditions (e.g.,
    involving out-of-the-way angles or sums of unrelated angles) often
    become much more tractable after an inversion.

3.  **Partial inversion:** Sometimes, it can be helpful to invert part
    of a diagram and compare the image of the inversion with the
    original diagram, rather than inverting the whole diagram at once.

Inversion Exercises
===================

1.  [[[
    $ABC$ is a triangle with incenter $I$, orthocenter $H$,
    circumcenter $O$, and circumcircle $\Gamma$. Let $AH$
    meet $BC$ at $D$ and let $AI$ meet $\Gamma$ at
    $M$. An inversion about $A$ with arbitrary radius maps
    $B$ and $C$ to $B'$ and $C'$, respectively. Identify
    the images of $I$, $O$, $BC$, $\Gamma$, $D$, and
    $M$ under this inversion with respect to triangle $AB'C'$.

3.  [[[
    Circle $\omega$ is internally tangent to circle $\Gamma$ at
    a point $P$, and is tangent to a chord $AB$ of $\Gamma$
    at a point $S$. Prove that ray $PS$ meets $\Gamma$ again
    at the midpoint of $\widehat{AB}$. (Separately invert the
    diagram about each of the points $P$, $A$, and $S$, and
    solve the problem in each of the inverted diagrams.)

4.  [[[
    Triangle $ABC$ satisfies $\angle BAC = 120^{\circ}$. The
    bisectors of angles $A$, $B$, and $C$ meet sides
    $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$,
    respectively. Prove that $\angle EDF = 90^{\circ}$ by inverting
    about $D$, and inverting again about the image of $A$.
