Ceva’s Theorem
==============

Regular Ceva
------------

Ceva’s theorem states that if $ABC$ is a triangle, and $D$,
$E$, and $F$ are points on $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$,
respectively, then segments $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are
concurrent if and only if 
\[ \frac{BD}{DC} \cdot \frac{CE}{EA} \cdot \frac{AF}{FB} = 1. \]

I will first outline two proof of the only if direction. Suppose that
$AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ intersect at a point $P$. We wish
to show that in this case, equation (1) holds.

1.  Find the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABD$ and $ADC$,
    and the ratio of the areas of triangles $PBD$ and $PDC$.
    Using this, determine the ratio $\frac{[APB]}{[APC]}$, and use
    this ratio to prove equation (1).

2.  Let $\ell$ be a line through $A$ parallel to $BC$. Let
    $BP$ and $CP$ meet $\ell$ at points $Y$ and $Z$,
    respectively. Compute $\frac{CE}{EA}$ and $\frac{AF}{FB}$ in
    terms of ratios involving $AZ$ or $AY$.

Now for the other direction. Suppose that $D, E, F$ are points on
the sides of $ABC$ so that (1) holds. Define $P$ to be the point
where $BE$ and $CF$ intersect, and let $D'$ be the point
where $AP$ meets $BC$. Use the only if direction of the proof to
show that $D' = D$, and explain why this proves Ceva’s theorem.

Generalized Angle Bisector Theorem
----------------------------------

This result is not directly related to Ceva’s theorem, but will often be
helpful when chasing ratios of lengths.

1.  Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let $D$ be a point on side
    $BC$. Show that
    \[\frac{AC \sin \angle DAC}{AB \sin \angle BAD} = \frac{CD}{DB}.\]


Trig Ceva
---------

There is an analogous statement of Ceva’s theorem, concering the
sines of the angles made by the cevians instead of the side lengths. If
$ABC$ is a triangle, and $D$, $E$, and $F$ are points on
$BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively, then segments $AD$,
$BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent if and only if \[\begin{aligned}
 \frac{\sin \angle CAD}{\sin \angle DAB} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle ABE}{\sin \angle EBC} \cdot \frac{\sin \angle BCF}{\sin \angle FCA} = 1. \end{aligned}\]
Show directly that equation (2) holds if and only if equation (1) holds
using the generalized angle bisector theorem.

Basic Applications
==================

1.  [[[Prove that the medians of a triangle are concurrent.]]]

2.  [[[Prove that the angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent.]]]

3.  [[[Prove that the altitudes of a triangle are concurrent.]]]

4.  [[[Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let its incircle touch sides
    $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$ at $D$, $E$, and $F$,
    respectively. Show that $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are
    concurrent. (This point of concurrency is called the *Gergonne
    point* of $ABC$.)]]]

5.  [[[Let $P$ be a point inside a triangle $ABC$. Let $\ell_a$
    be the reflection of $AP$ across the bisector of $\angle A$,
    $\ell_b$ be the reflection of $BP$ across the bisector of
    $\angle B$, and $\ell_c$ be the reflection of $CP$
    across the bisector of $\angle C$.

    1.  Show that $\ell_a, \ell_b,$ and $\ell_c$ are
        concurrent at a point $P'$. (This point $P'$ is called
        the *isogonal conjugate* of $P$.)

    2.  Show that the isogonal conjugate of $P'$ is $P$.

    3.  Show that the circumcenter and the orthocenter of $ABC$
        are isogonal conjugates.]]]

6.  [[[Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let $D$, $E$, and
    $F$ be points on sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$,
    respectively, such that $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are
    concurrent at a point $P$. Let $D', E'$, and $F'$ be the
    reflections of $D$, $E$, and $F$ across the midpoints of
    sides $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively. Show that
    $AD'$, $BE'$, and $CF'$ are concurrent at a point
    $P'$. (The point $P'$ is called the *isotomic conjugate* of
    $P$. Isotomic conjugates are not as important as isogonal
    conjugates, though knowing about isogonal conjugates isn’t
    particularly important either—I just threw these here as
    tidbits.)]]]

    perpendicular from $A$ to line $B_1 C_1$, the perpendicular
    from $B$ to line $A_1 C_1$, and the perpendicular from
    $C$ to line $C_1 A_1$ are concurrent. (Don’t use radical
    axes for this. Drop perpendiculars from $A_1, B_1, C_1$ to the
    sides, do some angle chasing, and use Ceva’s theorem..
