Trees
=====

There are many equivalent definitions of trees. We let $n$ denote
the number of vertices. Some definitions of trees are given below:

-   A connected graph without cycles

-   A minimal connected graph (removing any edge disconnects the graph)

-   A maximal graph without cycles (adding any edge causes a cycle)

-   A graph with $n-1$ edges without a cycle.

-   A connected graph with $n-1$ edges.

*Cayley’s Theorem* There are $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees of a $K_n$
with labeled vertices.

1.  [[[Given a spanning tree of graph $G$, we are allowed to remove
    an edge from the tree and insert and edge from the graph $G$ so
    that a new spanning tree is created. Show that every spanning tree
    can be reached by a succession of such operations.]]]

2.  [[[Some pairs of the 100 towns in a country are connected by two-way
    flights. It is given that one can reach any town from any other by a
    sequence of flights. Prove that one can fly and visit every town,
    with a total of at most 198 flights. (Can you get it down to
    196?)]]]

3.  [[[Alice and Bob play the following game on a given simple connected
    graph $G$. Alice starts the game. At each of her turns, she
    deletes an edge of $G$. Following Alice, Bob fixed an edge at
    each of his turns. A fixed edge can not be deleted. Bob wins if he
    builds a spanning tree of $G$, otherwise Alice wins. Show that
    if $G$ has two edge-disjoint spanning trees, then Bob wins the
    game (In fact, this is also the necessary condition).]]]

Hamiltonian Cycles
==================

A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle which visits all the vertices in a graph.
A graph is called Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian cycle.

*Dirac’s Theorem* A graph with $n$ vertices, where each vertex has
degree $\geq n/2$, has a Hamiltonian cycle.

Dirac’s Theorem can be strengthened slightly to:

*Ore’s Theorem* A graph with $n$ vertices is Hamiltonian if for
every pair of non-adjacent vertices the sum of their degrees is at least
$n$.

1.  Show Dirac’s Theorem.

2.  [[[Show that if for all $i \leq n/2$ there are at most $i-1$
    vertices of degree $i$ or less then there is a Hamiltonian
    cycle.]]]

3.  [[[An $n$-cube is a cube in $n$ dimensions. A cube in one
    dimension is a line segment; in two dimensions,it’s a square,in
    three, a normal cube, and in general,to go to the next dimension, a
    copy of the cube is made and all corresponding vertices are
    connected. If we consider the cube to be composed of the vertices
    and edges only, show that every $n$-cube has a Hamiltonian
    cycle.]]]

Coloring
========

A proper coloring of the graph is a coloring of the vertices such that
the no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The minimum number of
colors to properly color a graph $G$ is called the *chromatic
number* of $G$, and is sometimes written as $\chi(G)$.

Let $\Delta(G)$ be the maximum degree of $G$. Clearly,
$\Delta(G)+1$ is an upper bound on $\chi(G)$. A vertex can have
at most $\Delta(G)$ different colors adjacent to it, so with
$\Delta(G)+1$ colors we can always pick a color for each vertex no
matter what order we color the vertices in. In most cases, the bound on
chromatic number is actually $\Delta(G)$.

*Brook’s Theorem* If $G$ is a connected graph then
$\chi(G) \leq \Delta(G)$ unless $G$ is a complete graph or an
odd cycle.

*The Four Color Theorem* Any planar graph can be colored with at most
four colors. (Interestingly, this proof required computers to do a bunch
of case checking and there is currently no proof that doesn’t require
checking a few hundred cases.)

1.  [[[Given a graph $G$, prove that there exists a polynomial
    $\chi_G(x)$ such that, $\chi_G(k)$ is the number of ways to
    properly color the vertices of $G$ in $k$ colors.]]]

2.  [[[Prove that every planar graph can be properly colored with at
    most 5 colors (without using the four color theorem).]]]

Problems
========

1.  [[[
    Prove that every graph with average degree $d$ contains a
    subgraph in which every vertex has degree at least $d/2$.

    ]]]

2.  [[[
    Prove that any two longest paths in a connected graph have a vertex
    in common.

    ]]]

3.  [[[
    (BAMO 2004) Given a positive integer $n$, find the smallest
    $e$ such that every graph on $n$ vertices with $e$ edges
    is connected.

    ]]]

4.  [[[
    (BMC, 2006) There are 2008 managers in a boring corporate meeting.
    Each manager has exactly one boss, who may or not be among the other
    managers present at the meeting. A manager is *powerful* if he is
    the boss of at least four other managers at the meeting. What is the
    maximum possible number of powerful managers?

    ]]]

5.  [[[
    Let $G$ be a graph where all degrees are even. Find a way to
    trace out an Eulerian circuit on $G$ by following a simple rule.
    (examples of a simple rule (but which don’t work): always go to the
    vertex with highest remaining degree, or always go to a vertex which
    has been visited the least number of times.)

    ]]]

6.  [[[
    Given a graph $G$, we start modifying it as follows: In each
    round, as long as $G$ is cyclic, pick an arbitrary cycle of
    $G$, e.g. $C$, and remove all the edges of $C$ from
    $G$. Then, add a new vertex to the graph, e.g. $v_C$, and
    connect $v_C$ to all the vertices of $C$ (note that the
    newly added vertex can be on the cycles that we pick in the next
    rounds). Show that regardless of the choice of cycles, $G$
    becomes a forest (collection of trees) after a finite number of
    rounds

7.  [[[
    A connected graph with at least two vertices has the property that,
    if any $k$ edges are removed, it is still connected. Prove that
    any two vertices $v, w$, there are at least $k+1$ edge
    disjoint paths connecting $v$ to $w$.

8.  [[[
    Given a connected graph $G$, find the necessary and sufficient
    conditions for coloring its edges with two colors, black and white,
    such that for any vertex, both colors occur among its edges. (*Hint:
    This is impossible to do in an odd cycle*)

    ]]]

9.  [[[
    A complete graph on $6n$ vertices has its edges colored red and
    blue. Prove that we can find $n$ triangles, all of whose
    vertices are distinct, and with all $3n$ of their edges the same
    color.
