[h2]Things to Keep in Mind[/h2]
[ol]
  [li][b]Strong induction:[/b] If we want to prove a proposition $P(n)$ about natural numbers $n$, the principle of induction tells us that it is enough to show that $P(1)$ holds and that $P(n)$ always implies $P(n+1)$. Strong induction says that, when trying to prove that $P(n+1)$ is true, in addition to assuming that $P(n)$ is true, we may also assume each of $P(1), P(2), \ldots, P(n-1)$ is true as well.[/li]
  [li][b]Strengthening the hypothesis:[/b] Sometimes, using induction on a problem directly will not work, but induction [i]will[/i] work if we strengthen the problem a little bit. While this may seem counterintuitive, proving a stronger problem allows us to assume more in the inductive hypothesis.[/li]

  [li]{{{Prove that $\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^2} < 2$ for all positive integers $n$.}}}[/li]

  [li]{{{In a tournament with $n$ players, each player plays against every other player exactly once, and each match results in either a victory or a loss. Show that we can order the players $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$ in such a way that $P_i$ beat $P_{i+1}$ for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1$.}}}[/li]

  [li]{{{(USAMO 2010) There are $n$ students standing in a circle, one behind the other. The students have heights $h_1<h_2<\dots <h_n$. If a student with height $h_k$ is standing directly behind a student with height $h_{k-2}$ or less, the two students are permitted to switch places. Prove that it is not possible to make more than $\binom{n}{3}$ such switches before reaching a position in which no further switches are possible.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Fundamental theorem of symmetric polynomials) A polynomial $P(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ in $n$ variables is called [i]symmetric[/i] if it remains the same when any two of the variables are interchanged. Define the elementary symmetric polynomials $e_k(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ for $1 \leq k \leq n$ as
  \begin{align*}
  e_1 (x_1, x_2, \dots,x_n) &= \textstyle \sum_{1 \leq j \leq n} x_j,\\
  e_2 (x_1, x_2, \dots,x_n) &= \textstyle \sum_{1 \leq j < k \leq n} x_j x_k,\\

  [li]{{{(ISL 2010) On some planet, there are $2^N$ countries $(N \geq 4).$ Each country has a flag $N$ units wide and one unit high composed of $N$ fields of size $1 \times 1,$ each field being either yellow or blue. No two countries have the same flag. We say that a set of $N$ flags is diverse if these flags can be arranged into an $N \times N$ square so that all $N$ fields on its main diagonal will have the same color. Determine the smallest positive integer $M$ such that among any $M$ distinct flags, there exist $N$ flags forming a diverse set.}}}[/li]
