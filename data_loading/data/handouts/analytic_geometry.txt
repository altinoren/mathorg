1.  [[[Show that if $A, B, C$ are vectors, then the centroid of
    $\triangle ABC$ is $(A+B+C)/3$.]]]

2.  [[[(Extended Pythagorean theorem) Show that if $A,B,C,D$ are
    points in a plane, then $AC \perp BD$ iff
    $AB^2 - AD^2 = CB^2 - CD^2$.]]]

3.  [[[Let $k$ be a positive real number. Show that for points
    $A,B$, the locus of all points $P$ with
    $\frac{PA}{PB} = k$ is a circle (Apollonius theorem).]]]

4.  [[[(Napoleon triangle) Erect triangles outwardly on the sides of a
    triangle. Show that the triangle formed by connecting the centers of
    the equilateral triangles is itself equialteral.]]]

5.  [[[Let $a,b,c$ be points in the complex plane. Show that
    $a,b,c$ are the vertices of an equilateral triangle if and only
    if $a^2+b^2+c^2=ab+bc+ca$.]]]

6.  [[[Show that if $A, B, C$ are vectors with magnitude 1, then the
    orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$ is $A+B+C$. (Conclude that
    the circumcenter, orthocenter, and centroid of any triangle are
    collinear.)]]]

7.  [[[Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Construct squares $ACDE$ and
    $ABFG$ externally on sides $AC$ and $AB$. Let $M$ be
    the midpoint of $GE$. Show that $MA \perp BC$.]]]

8.  [[[$A_1B_1C_1$ and $A_2 B_2 C_2$ are triangles. Suppose that
    the perpendicular from $A_1$ to $B_2C_2$, the perpendicular
    from $B_1$ to $C_2A_2$, and the perpendicular from $C_1$
    to $A_2 B_2$ are concurrent. Show that the perpendicular from
    $A_2$ to $B_1 C_1$, the perpendicular from $B_2$ to
    $C_1 A_1$, and the perpendicular from $C_2$ to $A_1 B_1$
    are concurrent as well. (Such two triangles are called *orthologic
    triangles*.)]]]

9.  [[[(ISL 2001) Let $ABC$ be a triangle with centroid $G$.
    Determine, with proof, the position of the point $P$ in the
    plane of $ABC$ such that
    $AP{\cdot}AG + BP{\cdot}BG + CP{\cdot}CG$ is a minimum, and
    express this minimum value in terms of the side lengths of
    $ABC$.]]]

10. [[[(USA TSTST 2012) $ABCD$ is a cyclic quadrilateral, and
    segments $AC$ and $BD$ intersect at $P$. The feet of the
    perpendiculars from $P$ to $AB$ and $CD$ are $E$ and
    $F$, respectively. $CE$ and $BF$ intersect at $Q$.
    Show that $PQ \perp EF$.]]]
