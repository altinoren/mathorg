1.  [[[We have $n\geq 2$ lamps $L_1,L_2,\ldots,L_n$ in a row, each
    of them being either *on* or *off*. Every second we simultaneously
    modify the state of each lamp as follows:  
    1.  if the lamp $L_i$ and its neighbors (only one neighbor for
        $i=1$ and $i=n$, two neighbors for other $i$) are in
        the same state, then $L_i$ is switched off;  
    2.  otherwise, $L_i$ is switched on.  
    Initially all the lamps are off except the leftmost one which is on.  
    1.  Prove that there are infinitely many integers $n$ for
        which all the lamps will eventually be off.  
    2.  Prove that there are infinitely many integers $n$ for
        which all the lamps will eventually be on.]]]

2.  [[[An $n\times n$ checkerboard is divided into $1\times 1$
    squares. It is allowed to place dominoes on the checkerboard, each
    of which exactly covers two adjacent squares, provided that no two
    dominoes cover the same square, and no two dominoes cover squares
    which share an edge. (It is allowed for two dominoes to cover
    squares which share only a corner.) Find the largest constant
    $c$ such that for any $n\geq 2008$, once can always fit at
    least $cn^2-n$ dominoes on the board.]]]

3.  [[[A large rectangle in the plane is partitioned into smaller
    rectangles, each of which has either integer height or integer width
    (or both). Prove that the large rectangle also has this property.]]]

4.  [[[Let $n$ be a given integer greater than one. There are
    $n$ bags of balls. The weight, in grams, of each ball is a
    perfect power of two. (A bag can have balls of the same weight.) If
    the total weight of the balls in each bag is the same, then there
    exist $k_n$ balls (in all the bags) of the same weight.
    Determine the maximum value of $k_n$.]]]

5.  [[[Let $n$ be a given integer greater than $2$. We wish to
    label each side and each diagonal of a regular $n$-gon
    $P_1P_2\cdots P_n$ with a positive integer less than or equal to
    $r$ so that

    1.  every integer between $1$ and $r$ occurs as a label;

    2.  in each triangle $P_iP_jP_k$ two of the labels are equal and
        greater than the third.

    Given these conditions:

    1.  Determine the largest positive integer $r$ for which this
        can be done.

    2.  For that maximum value of $r$, how many such labelings are
        there?]]]

6.  [[[In an $m\times n$ rectangular board of $mn$ unit squares,
    two squares are *adjacent* if they share a common edge. A *path*[[[
    is a sequence of squares in which any two consecutive squares are
    adjacent. Each square of the board can be colored black or white.
    Let $N$ denote the number of coloring schemes of the board such
    that there exists at least one black path from the left edge of the
    board to its right edge, and let $M$ denote the number of
    coloring schemes in which there exist at least two non-intersecting
    black paths from the left edge to the right edge. Prove that
    $N^2\geq M\cdot 2^{mn}$.]]]

7.  [[[Points $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$, with no three collinear, are given
    in the plane. Each point is colored in either red or blue. A
    nonempty set $S$ of the triangles with $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$
    as their vertices is called *good* if for every pair of segments
    $P_iP_j$ and $P_uP_v$, the number of triangles in $S$
    containing side $P_iP_j$ is equal to the number of triangles in
    $S$ containing side $P_uP_v$. A triangle is called
    *monochromatic*[[[ if all its vertices are of the same color.
    Determine the minimum value of $n$ such that there are always
    two monochromatic triangles in any good set.]]]

8.  [[[There is a set of $n$ coins with distinct integer weights
    $w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n$. It is known that if any coin with weight
    $w_k$, $1\leq k\leq n$, is removed from the set, the
    remaining coins can be split into two groups of the same weight.
    (The number of coins in the two groups can be different.) Find all
    $n$ for which such a set of coins exists.]]]

9.  [[[Can we tile a $13\times 13$ table from which we remove the
    central unit square using only $1\times 4$ or $4\times 1$
    rectangles?]]]

10. [[[In the Cartesian coordinate plane define the strip
    \[S_n=\{(x,y):n\leq x\leq n+1\}\] for every integer $n$.
    Assume that each strip $S_n$ is colored either red or blue, and
    let $a$ and $b$ be two distinct positive integers. Prove
    that there exists a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$
    such that its vertices have the same color.]]]

11. [[[A (simple and finite) graph is called *balanced*[[[ if it has
    $n$ edges, and it is possible to assign each of the numbers
    $1,2,\ldots,n$ to an edge (one number per edge) in such a way
    that the sum of the numbers assigned to the edges connecting to each
    vertex is the same. Determine if every balanced graph is
    connected.]]]

12. [[[Find all positive integers $n$, for which the numbers in the set
    $S=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ can be colored red and blue, with the
    following condition being satisfied: the set $S\times S\times S$
    contains exactly 2007 ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ such that (i)
    $x,y,z$ are of the same color and (ii) the integer $x+y+z$
    is divisible by $n$.]]]

13. [[[For what values of $n$ is it possible to color every square in
    an $n\times n$ grid red, blue, yellow, green, or orange, so that
    for all $i,j,k$ between $1$ and $n$ with $i\neq j$
    and $j\neq k$, the square in row $i$ and column$j$ is
    assigned a different color from the square in row $j$ and column
    $k$?]]]
