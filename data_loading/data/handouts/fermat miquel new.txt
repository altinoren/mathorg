As a warm-up, here are some classic problems that you may have seen before:

[ol]

[li]{{{Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle.  Let $P$ be a point in $ABC$ such that the distances from $P$ to $A$, $B$ and $C$ are 3, 4 and 5,
    respectively.  Find the area of $\triangle ABC$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $ABC$ be an equilateral triangle.  Let $P$ be a point on arc $BC$ of the circumcircle of $ABC$.  Show $PA=PB+PC$.}}}[/li]
  
These two problems are in fact remarkably connected.  Let's now analyze the situation more closely.

[li]{{{Show that for any other point $P$, $PA > PB+PC$.  This suggests that we can construct a triangle that has side lengths $PA, PB, PC$ for any
    point $P$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{In fact, using a rotation that's the reverse of problem 1, we can solve problems 2 and 3.  Note that when $P$ is on the circumcircle, we get
    a degenerate triangle.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Rather than using Ptolemy's theorem to solve problems 2 and 3, we can use 4 to prove Ptolemy's theorem.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{We are now armed to tackle a question proposed by Fermat as a challenge to Evangelista Torricelli.  Given a triangle, none of whose angles
    exceeds $\frac{2\pi}{3}$, find the point $F$ in the plane that minimizes $FA+FB+FC$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{*What happens when one of the angles exceeds $\frac{2\pi}{3}$?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given a triangle $ABC$, construct an equilateral triangle $A'BC$ externally on side $BC$.  Construct $B'$ and $C'$ similarly.  Show that
    $AA'=BB'=CC'$, and that the lines $AA', BB', CC'$ concur.  Moreover, show that these lines make angles of $\frac{\pi}{3}$ with one another.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(USAMO 1974/5) Consider two triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle PQR$.  Let $D$ be a point inside $\triangle ABC$ such that $\angle
    ADB=\angle BDC=\angle CDA = \frac{2\pi}{3}$ and let $DA=u$, $DB=v$ and $DC=w$.  Let $M$ be a point inside an equilateral $\triangle PQR$ with
    side length $x$ such that $MP=a$, $MQ=b$ and $MR=c$, where $a$, $b$ and $c$ are the sides of $\triangle ABC$. Show $u+v+w=x$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{*There exists one other equilateral triangle $\triangle P'Q'R'$ such that there is a point $M'$ such that $M'P'=a$, $M'Q'=b$ and $M'R'=c$.
    Can you find it?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{*Find the analogue of problem 9 for this equilateral triangle $\triangle P'Q'R'$.  (You will also find another ``Fermat" point $F'$.)}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Erect equilateral triangles externally on the sides of $\triangle ABC$. Let their centers be $O_1$, $O_2$ and $O_3$.  Show that $\triangle
    O_1O_2O_3$ is equilateral.  (One approach: $O_2AO_3F$ is a kite)}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Erect equilateral triangles internally on the sides of $\triangle ABC$.  Let their centers be $N_1$, $N_2$ and $N_3$. Show that $\triangle
    N_1N_2N_3$ is equilateral, but with opposite orientation to $\triangle O_1O_2O_3$.}}}[/li]
  
So here's the punchline:

[li]{{{Show that $\triangle PQR$ in problem 9 and $\triangle O_1O_2O_3$ in problem 12 are related by a factor of $\frac{1}{\surd 3}$.  In fact $F,
    O_1, O_2, O_3$ are in a similar configuration to $M, P, Q, R$.  Similarly, show that $\triangle P'Q'R'$ from problem 10 and $\triangle
    N_1N_2N_3$ from problem 13 are related by a factor of $\frac{1}{\surd 3}$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Show furthermore that $[PQR]-[P'Q'R']=3[ABC]$ or that, using signed areas, $[O_1O_2O_3]+[N_1N_2N_3]=[ABC]$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Show that $\triangle O_1O_2O_3$ and $\triangle N_1N_2N_3$ have the same center.  Their center is the centroid of $ABC$.}}}[/li]
  
We've discovered a lot!  Let's summarize what we know.  Given a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths $a, b$ and $c$, we can construct
an equilateral triangle $PQR$ and a point $M$ such that $MP=a$, $MQ=b$ and $MR=c$.  In fact, there are two such triangles an ``outer" one (problem
9) and an ``inner" one (problem 10).  These are related to the outer and inner Napoleon triangles.  They are also related to the Fermat point.


Let's rephrase this in another way.  Given an equilateral triangle $PQR$, and some triangle $ABC$ with side lengths $a, b$ and $c$, we can
construct a point $M$ such that $MP:MQ:MR=a:b:c$.

[li]{{{When $ABC$ is a degenerate triangle, there is exactly one such point, and when $ABC$ is nondegenerate there are two such points.  They turn
    out to be inverses of one another with respect to the circumcircle of $PQR$.}}}[/li]
  
This might lead us to consider the following problem: given three points in the plane, $P$, $Q$, and $R$, and three lengths $x, y$
and $z$, when can we construct a point $M$ such that $MP:MQ:MR=x:y:z$?  Certainly Ptolemy's inequality implies that we need $QR \cdot x + RP \cdot y
\geq PQ \cdot z$.  Is this sufficient?  It turns out it is.

[li]{{{**Suppose $QR \cdot x$, $RP \cdot y$ and $PQ \cdot z$ satisfy the triangle inequality.  Then we can construct a point $M$ such that
    $MP:MQ:MR=x:y:z$.  We proceed as follows.  Construct a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths $a$, $b$ and $c$ proportional to $QR \cdot x$, $RP \cdot
    y$ and $PQ \cdot z$.  Construct triangles $A'BC$, $AB'C$ and $ABC'$ all externally to $ABC$ so that $A'BC$, $AB'C$, and $ABC'$ are all similar
    to $PQR$.  Then $AA', BB', CC'$ concur in a point $F$ which also lies on the circumcircles of triangles $A'BC$, $AB'C$ and $ABC'$.  This point
    $F$ minimizes $QR \cdot AF + RP \cdot BF + PQ \cdot CF$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{**Let $O_1$, $O_2$ and $O_3$ be the circumcenters of $A'BC$, $AB'C$ and $ABC'$.  Then $O_1O_2O_3$ is similar to $PQR$.  Moreover,
    $FO_1:FO_2:FO_3=x:y:z$.  Had we constructed $A'BC$, $AB'C$ and $ABC'$ internally, we would have found another triangle $N_1N_2N_3$ similar to
    $PQR$ but with opposite orientation.  Using signed areas, $[O_1O_2O_3]+[N_1N_2N_3]=[ABC]$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{**Let us rephrase what we know.  Given any triangle $PQR$, we can construct a point $M$ with $MP:MQ:MR=x:y:z$ whenever $QR \cdot x$, $RP \cdot
    y$ and $PQ \cdot z$ satisfy the triangle inequality.  When this triangle is degenerate, we can construct exactly one such point.  When this
    triangle is nondegenerate, we can can construct two such points.  They turn out to be inverses of one another with respect to the circumcircle
    of $PQR$.}}}[/li]
  
Now given $PQR$ and a point $M$ in the plane, how can we construct a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths proportional to $QR \cdot PM$,
$RP \cdot QM$, $PQ \cdot RM$?  One way comes from problem 1: we construct a point $S$ with $PSQ$ similar to $PMR$.  Then $QSM$ is the desired
triangle.  (Note that this was also how we proved Ptolemy's theorem.)


Another way to proceed is to drop perpendiculars from $M$ to $QR$, $RP$ and $PQ$ and let the feet of these perpendiculars be $A$, $B$ and
$C$.  This will lead us to our next topic: the Miquel point.

[li]{{{Show that $BC=PM \cdot QR/2r$, where $r$ is the radius of the circumcircle of $PQR$.  Conclude that $ABC$ is the desired triangle.  (Observe that we could have concluded this from the fact that $O_2AO_3F$ is a kite used in problem 12.)}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Use this to give yet another proof of Ptolemy's inequality.  When does equality hold?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Simson Line) The feet of the perpendiculars from a point $P$ to the sides of a triangle $ABC$ are collinear if and only if $P$ is on the
    circumcircle of $ABC$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Miquel point) Let $P$, $Q$, $R$ be points on sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$ of a triangle $ABC$.  Then the circumcircles of $AQR$, $PBR$ and $PQC$ concur in a point, the Miquel point $M$ associated to the triple $P$, $Q$, $R$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{The lines from the Miquel point $M$ to the points $P$, $Q$, $R$ make equal angles with the sides $BC$, $CA$, $AB$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{$\angle BMC= \angle BAC + \angle QPR$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Analyze all triples which have the same Miquel point $M$.  They form a system of similar triangles obtained by spiral similarity about $M$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{*Show that we can make $PQR$ similar to any given triangle we like.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{*Show that there are two points $M$, $M'$ which yield systems of triangles similar to $PQR$.  The two sets of triangles will have opposite
    orientations.  Moreover, $M$ and $M'$ are inverses with respect to the circumcircle of $ABC$.  Compare to problems 17 and 20.}}}[/li]
  
We can quickly deduce the following facts. 1) The centers of any set of Miquel circles are vertices of a triangle similar to $ABC$. 2) Two or more directly similar triangles with corresponding vertices on the same sides of $ABC$ have the same Miquel point. 3) If three circles concur in a point, it is possible to start at any point of one of the circumferences ad draw a triangle whose vertices lies on the circles and whose sides
pass through the corresponding intersections; all such triangles are similar.  Note that problem 21 gives us a relationship between the side
lengths of $ABC$, $PQR$, the circumradius of $ABC$ and the lengths $AM$, $BM$, $CM$.

[li]{{{Problem 26 allows us to conclude that if $P$, $Q$, $R$ are collinear, then $M$ lies on the circumcircle of $ABC$.  This is related to the
    Simson line.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Analyze the Simson lines of the vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ and also the points diametrically opposite them.}}}[/li]

  [li]{{{Show that the circumcircles of the four triangles determined by four lines are concurrent.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given four lines, there is exactly one point from which the perpendiculars from this point to the four lines are collinear.}}}[/li]

    $RP$, and from $C$ to line $PQ$ are concurrent.  These perpendiculars concur in the Fermat point.}}}[/li]

Some miscellaneous related problems:

[li]{{{First, some exercises using the methods of problem 12 (rotations, vectors).  Given $\triangle ABC$, erect equilateral triangles $\triangle
    ABD$ and $\triangle BCE$ externally.  Show that the midpoints of $AC$, $BD$ and $BE$ from an equilateral triangle.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given $\triangle ABC$, erect equilateral triangles $\triangle ABD$ and $\triangle BCE$ externally and $\triangle AFC$ internally.  What are
    the angles of the triangle formed by the center of $\triangle AFC$, $D$ and $E$?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given $\triangle ABC$, erect an equilateral triangle on side $AB$ and a regular hexagon on side $AC$.  Let their centers be $D$ and $E$, and
    let the midpoint of $BC$ be $F$.  Find $\angle DFE$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Here's an extension of problem 2.  Let $\triangle ABC$ be equilateral and let $P$ be a point on the arc $BC$ of its circumcircle.  Let $AP$
    intersect $BC$ at $Q$.  Show that $\frac{1}{PQ}=\frac{1}{BP}+\frac{1}{CP}$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Morley Triangle) This is a beautiful problem about equilateral triangles that's unrelated to the above, but nonetheless very beautiful.

$C_3$, and the external angle trisector of $\angle C$ closer to $AC$ and the internal angle trisector of $\angle A$ closer to $AC$ intersect at
$B_3$.  Show $\triangle A_2B_3C_3$ is equilateral.}}}[/li]
  
These next two problems are reminiscent of problem 12.
