Useful Facts
============

Basic Properties
----------------

1.  Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and suppose $D$ is on segment
    $BC$ such that $AD$ is a symmedian. Then
    \[\frac{\sin \angle DAB}{\sin \angle CAD} = \frac{AB}{AC}, \mbox{and} \frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB^2}{AC^2}.\]

2.  Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let the tangents at $B$ and
    $C$ to the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ meet at $S$.
    Then $AS$ is a symmedian of triangle $ABC$.

3.  The three symmedians of $ABC$ are concurrent. (The point of
    concurrency is called the *symmedian point*, or the *Lemoine
    point*.)

Harmonic Quadrilaterals
-----------------------

1.  [[[Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. Then the tangents to the
    circumcircle at $B$ and $D$ concur with diagonal $AC$ if
    and only if $AB \cdot CD = AD \cdot BC$. Conclude that the
    tangents to the circumcircle at $B$ and $D$ concur with
    diagonal $AC$ if and only if the tangents to the circumcircle at
    $A$ and $C$ concur with diagonal $BD$. (A quadrilateral
    satisfying $AB \cdot CD = AD \cdot BC$ is called a *harmonic
    quadrilateral*.)]]]

2.  [[[Let $ABCD$ be a harmonic quadrilateral. Let its diagonals
    intersect at $E$, and let the tangents to its circumcircle at
    $A$ and $C$ meet at $F$. Show that
    $\frac{FB}{FD} = -\frac{EB}{ED}$, where the length of each
    segment is directed.]]]

3.  [[[Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral, and let $P$ be a
    point on its circumcircle. Let $\ell$ be any line, and let lines
    $PA, PB, PC, PD$ meet $\ell$ at $A', B', C'$, and
    $D'$. Show that quadrilateral $ABCD$ is harmonic if and only
    if $\frac{A'B'}{A'D} = -\frac{C'B'}{C'D'}$, where the length of
    each segment is directed.]]]

A Special Point
---------------

Let $ABC$ be a triangle inscribed in a circle $\Gamma$ centered
at $O$. Let the tangents to $\Gamma$ at $B$ and $C$ meet
at $S$.

1.  There exists a unique point $P$ such that $\triangle PBA$ is
    directly similar to $\triangle PAC$.

2.  $AP$ is a symmedian of $\triangle ABC$.

3.  $OPBCS$ is cyclic.

4.  $OP \perp AP$.

5.  If $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of $AB$ and $AC$,
    respectively, then $AMNOP$ is cyclic.
