[li]Use induction to prove that all horses have the same color.


[b]Solution.[/b] Let us first prove the statement. For a positive integer $n$, let the $n$-th statement be:
``Given any $n$ horses, they have the same color.'' It is clearly true for $n=1$. Assuming the statement for some $n$, let us consider what happens with $n+1$ horses. If we order them, the first $n$ will have same color by induction hypothesis. Similarly, the last $n$ will have same color. Hence, all the $n+1$ have the same color. By induction, $n$-th statement is true for all positive integers $n$ and since there are finitely many horses, they all have the same color.


Which one do you trust more: the proof above or your eyes? Which one of the following do you think is correct?
(A) All horses really have the same color.
(B) Base case is wrong.
(C) Inductive step is wrong.
(D) There are infinitely many horses.[/li]
  [li]The exact quantity of gas needed for a car to complete a single loop around
a track is distributed among 100 containers placed along the track. Prove
that there exists a starting position at which the car, beginning with an
empty tank of gas, can complete a single loop around the track without
running out of gas.


[b]Solution.[/b] Let us replace 100 by $n$ and prove the statement by induction. $n=1$ case is clear. Consider the situation with $n+1$ stations while assuming the statement for $n$ stations.
Relocate the $n+1$th station at the $n$th station. Now, we have $n$ stations so there is a starting point that works. Note that the same starting point works for the $n+1$ stations.[/li]
  [li]$n \geq 1$ circles are given in the plane. They divide the
plane into regions. Show that it is possible to color the plane using
two colors, so that no two regions with a common boundary line
are assigned the same color.


[b]Solution.[/b] $n=1$ case is clear. Assume the statement for $n$ circles. Now, suppose one more circle is drawn. Let us readjust the coloring w.r.t. $n$ circles by switching the colors of any region that lies inside the $n+1$th circle. Why does it work?[/li]
