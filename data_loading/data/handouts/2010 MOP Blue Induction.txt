[h2]Examples.[/h2]
[ol]
[li]Let $n = 2^k$. We can select $n$ integers from any $(2n-1)$ integers
such that their sum is divisible by $n$.


[b]Solution.[/b] Let us use induction on $k$. Given any 3 numbers, two will have same parity so their sum will be even, which proves the base case $k=1$. Assume the statement for some $k$. Now, for the $k+1$ case, consider any $4n-1$ integers, where $n=2^k$. We want to find $2n$ of them whose sum is divisible by $2n$. If you think that $4n-1$ is about twice of $2n-1$ so we can use the inductive hypothesis twice, that alone unfortunately does not lead to a solution because we are wasting the unused numbers. If we recycle them, we can use the inductive hypothesis three times and get three set of $n$ numbers each having a sum divisible by $n$. Each is either $0$ or $n$ modulo $2n$. Hence, two must be same and the corresponding sum of those $2n$ integers have a sum divisible by $2n$ $\Box$[/li]
  [li]For a positive integer $n$ prove that
$$\left(1+\frac{1}{1^3}\right)\left(1+\frac{1}{2^3}\right)\cdots\left(1+\frac{1}{n^3}\right)<3.$$

[b]Solution.[/b] Induction on this problem itself does not work as the LHS grows with $n$ but RHS does not change. So, let us make the problem harder by replacing RHS by something smaller but that grows with $n$. A natural choice is $3-1/n$. Now, it is not difficult to prove by induction that $\displaystyle LHS<3-\frac{1}{n}$.
The base case $n=1$ gives $2<2.5$ and the induction step after simplifications amounts to $n^2-n+2>0$ which is correct $\Box$[/li]
  [li]Use induction to prove that $\displaystyle 11\times{80 \choose 40}\times2^{-80}<1$. (LHS turns out to be approximately $0.98$.)


[b]Solution.[/b] We will induct on 40. First, let us consider how 11 depends on 40. Let $a_n=2^{2n}/{2n \choose n}$. Then, investigating the small $a_n$'s we see that they grow at the rate of $\sqrt{n}$. Let us use $11=\sqrt{3\times40+1}$. The problem states that $a_{40}\geq11$ and we claim that $a_n\geq\sqrt{3n+1}$. $n=1$ case gives equality so we let the base case to be $n=2$ which gives $8/3>\sqrt{7}$ which is true. The inductive step amounts to $4(n+1)^2(3n+1)\geq(2n+1)^2(3n+4)$ after expanding which simplifies to $n\geq0$. Thus, by induction, our statement is true for all $n\geq2$ and in particular for $n=11$.[/li]
  [li](Alien invasion at MOP) One year, some aliens disguise themselves as MOPPERS. Students live in two-people rooms. Everyone knows all the aliens in other rooms but they have
no clue about the true identity of their roommates. Each student is extremely intelligent and knows that all the other students are intelligent as well. A student who can prove that his/her roommate is an alien must announce it immediately to everyone and treat him/her to an ice-cream as a sign of world hospitality. One day Zuming announces that there is at least one alien at MOP. Zuming always tells the truth and all the students trust him. If in fact there are exactly 6 aliens among 55 students but this fact is not known to the students what will be found out after Zuming's announcement?


(A) Aliens will be exposed.
(B) Team members are aliens.
(C) Zuming is an alien.

[b]Hint.[/b] Induct on 6 to prove $A$ and then note the paradoxical side.[/li]
  [li](IMO Shortlist '94) $M$ is a subset of $\{1, 2, 3, ... , 15\}$ such that the product of
any three distinct elements of $M$ is not a square. Determine the maximum
number of elements in $M$.
