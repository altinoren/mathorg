1.  [[[Find the centroid of $\triangle ABC$ in terms of arbitrary
    vector representations of its vertices.]]]

2.  [[[Using vectors, show that the circumcenter, centroid, center of
    the nine-point circle and the orthocenter are collinear and that the
    proportions of the lengths of segments connecting consecutive points
    along the resulting Euler line are $2:1:3$.]]]

3.  [[[Find the volume of tetrahedron $ABCD$ in terms of arbitrary
    vector represenations of its vertices.]]]

4.  [[[Let $ABCA'B'C'$ be a triangular prism (not necessarily right)
    with base $ABC$ and parallel edges $AA'$, $BB'$, and
    $CC'$. Let $P$ be the intersection of the planes
    $(ABC')$, $(AB'C)$, $(A'BC)$, and let $P'$ be the
    intersection of the planes $(AB'C')$, $(A'BC')$, and
    $(A'B'C)$. Show that $PP'$ is parallel to $AA'$.]]]

5.  [[[Consider three linearly independent vectors $\vec a$,
    $\vec b$ and $\vec c$ in space, having the same origin.
    Prove that the plane determined by their endpoints is perpendicular
    to the vector $\vec a\times \vec
      b+\vec b\times
      \vec c+\vec c\times \vec a$.]]]

6.  [[[Some students take a test consisting of $n$ problems. After
    it is over, the judges assign each problem a positive integral
    number of points, and give each student a score equal to the sum of
    the points for each problem that the student solved. (No partial
    credit!) It would have been possible for the judges to assign point
    values so that the studentsâ€™ scores finish in any possible order
    (not counting ties). What is the maximum number of students for
    which this would be able to happen?]]]

7.  [[[Given two triangles $\triangle ABC$ and
    $\triangle A'B'C'$ with distinct vertices and the same centroid,
    prove that a triangle can be formed from the three segments
    $\overline{AA'}$, $\overline{BB'}$ and
    $\overline{CC'}$.]]]

8.  [[[Prove that the four lines through each of the centroids of the
    four faces of a tetrahedron and perpendicular to their respective
    faces are concurrent if and only if the four altitudes of the
    tetrahedron are concurrent.]]]

9.  [[[Let $S$ be a set of 26 positive integers, none of whose prime
    factors are bigger than 100. Show that there exists a nonempty
    subset $A\subset S$ such that the product of the elements of
    $A$ is a perfect square.]]]

10. [[[Given three vectors $\vec a$, $\vec b$, and $\vec c$,
    define \[\vec u=(\vec b\cdot
      \vec c)\vec a-(\vec c\cdot \vec a)\vec b,\quad \vec v=(\vec a\cdot
      \vec c)\vec b-(\vec a\cdot \vec b)\vec c,\quad \vec w=(\vec b\cdot
      \vec a)\vec c-(\vec b\cdot \vec c)\vec a,.\] Prove that if
    $\vec
      a$, $\vec b$ and $\vec c$ form a triangle, then
    $\vec u$, $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ also form a triangle,
    and this triangle is similar to the first.]]]

11. [[[Let $W\subset \mathbb R^n$ be a subspace. Show that
    $(W^{\perp})^\perp=W$.]]]

12. [[[On each face of a convex polyhedron consider an outward vector
    with length numerically equal to the area of the face. Prove that
    the sum of all these vectors is equal to zero.]]]

13. [[[Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix of zeroes and ones that
    is symmetric (that is, $A_{ij}=A_{ji}$ for all $i,j$) and
    such that $A_{ii}=1$ for all $i$. Show that there exists a
    subset of the rows of $A$ whose sum is a vector all of whose
    components are odd.]]]

14. [[[In trapezoid $ABCD$, $AB||CD$, the midpoint of
    $\overline{AB}$ is $E$ and the midpoint of
    $\overline{CD}$ is $F$. Let $G$ be the intersection of
    $\overleftrightarrow{AD}$ and $\overleftrightarrow{BC}$ and
    $H$ the intersection of $\overleftrightarrow{AC}$ and
    $\overleftrightarrow{BD}$. Show that the line
    $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ passes through both $G$ and
    $H$.]]]

15. [[[Let $P$ be a point on a given unit sphere. Three mutually
    perpendicular rays from $P$ meet the sphere at $A$, $B$,
    and $C$. Prove that for all such triples of rays, the plane of
    $\triangle
      ABC$ passes through a fixed point.]]]

16. [[[The vectors $\vec a$, $\vec b$ and $\vec c$ in
    $\mathbb R^3$ satisfy
    \[\vec a\times \vec b = \vec b\times\vec c =
      \vec c\times \vec a \neq 0.\] Prove that
    $\vec a+\vec b+\vec c=0$.]]]

17. [[[Prove that the medians of a triangle form a triangle of $\frac
      34$ the area and with medians $\frac 34$ as long as those in
    the original triangle.]]]

18. [[[Let $k$ be a finite field (that is, a finite set with
    commutative, associative and distributive addition and
    multiplication with identities, additive inverses, and
    multiplicative inverses for nonzero elements). Prove that there
    exists a prime $p$ and a nonnegative integer $r$ such that
    $|k|=p^r$.]]]
