A locus is a set of points that all have some given property. For example

[ol]

[li]{{{The locus of points equidistant from points $A$ and $B$ is the perpendicular bisector of the segment $AB$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{The locus of points distance $R$ from a given point $O$ is the circle of radius $R$ centered at $O$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{The locus of points a given distance from a line $l$ is two parallel lines.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given an angle $\alpha$, the locus of points $C$ such that
$\angle ACB=\alpha$ is the union of
two arcs of circles symmetric through line $AB$ (points $A$ and $B$ do
not belong to the locus).}}}[/li]
  
Remark: If we define the angle $\angle ACB$ to be the amount we
need to rotate line $AC$ counterclockwise around $C$ to get line $BC$ (in other words, if we use directed angles),
then this locus becomes a circle (the points $A$ and $B$ can be
thought of as degenerate cases). Note that with this definition, if a
point $A'$ lies on the line $AC$, $\angle A'CB = \angle ACB$

[li]{{{Find the locus of points equidistant from two intersecting lines. Find the locus of points equidistant from two parallel lines.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Find the locus of the midpoints of segments with the endpoints on two given parallel lines.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{A $10$-foot ladder is placed vertically against a wall, and then
the foot of the ladder is moved outward, with the other end of the
ladder always touching the wall, until the ladder lies flat on the
floor with the other end touching the wall.  What is the locus of the
midpoint of the ladder as it slides?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Suppose two lines $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ meet at a point $O$. Let
$X_1$ and $X_2$ be the projections of some point $X$ onto $\ell_1$ and
$\ell_2$ resepectively. Find the locus of points $X$ such that
$OX_1+OX_2$ is constant.}}}[/li]
