[h3]Useful Facts[/h3] 

[ol]
  [li]Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and suppose $D$ is on segment $BC$ such that $AD$ is a symmedian. Then $\frac{\sin \angle DAB}{\sin \angle CAD} = \frac{AB}{AC}$, and $\frac{BD}{DC} = \frac{AB^2}{AC^2}$.[/li]
  [li]Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let the tangents at $B$ and $C$ to the circumcircle of triangle $ABC$ meet at $S$. Show that $AS$ is a symmedian of triangle $ABC$.[/li]
  [li]Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. Then the tangents to the circumcircle at $B$ and $D$ concur with diagonal $AC$ if and only if $AB \cdot CD = AD \cdot BC$. In particular, the tangents to the circumcircle at $B$ and $D$ concur with diagonal $AC$ if and only if the tangents to the circumcircle at $A$ and $C$ concur with diagonal $BD$.[/li]

  [li]{{{(ISL 2003) Three distinct points $A$, $B$, and $C$ lie on a line in that order. Let $\Gamma$ be a circle passing through $A$ and $C$ whose center does not lie on the line $AC$. The tangents to $\Gamma$ at $A$ and $C$ intersect at a point $P$. The segment $PB$ meets the circle $\Gamma$ at $Q$. Show that the point of intersection of the angle bisector of the angle $AQC$ with the line $AC$ does not depend on the choice of the circle $\Gamma$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Let $O$ be its circumcenter, and let $P$ be a point in its interior such that triangles $PBA$ and $PAC$ are directly similar. Prove that: 
  [ol]
    [li]line $AP$ is a symmedian of $\triangle ABC$.[/li]

[h3]Problems[/h3]
