Let's warm up by reviewing some basic facts about power of a point.

What are the possible values for the power of a point with respect to a circle? What is the locus of points with a fixed power with respect to a circle? Show that the power of a point outside of a circle is equal to $t^2$, where $t$ is the length of the tangent.

Construct the radical axis of two circles with a compass and straight-edge.

How do you calculate power of a point in co-ordinates? How do you calculate the radical axis of two circles in co-ordinates?

What is the radical axis of two concentric circles? What is the radical axis of a line and a circle?

What is the power of the incenter with respect to the circumcircle?

[h4]What is inversion?[/h4]

There are many ways to define inversion, some of them quite
beautiful, but in terms of sheer usefulness there's none better
than the simplest. An [i]inversion[/i] in a circle $C$ with radius
$r$ and center $O$ takes any point $P$ to another point $P'$ on
$OP$ such that $OP \cdot OP' = r^2$. The power of inversion is not
obvious from this definition, but at least it's clear. Note that
the set of fixed points is precisely the circle $C$.

The first question that springs to mind about this transformation
should be: What happens to $O$? There's no line $OO$ and the
inverse of the length of $OO$ is not defined. But if $O$ isn't mapped
anywhere, that means nothing gets mapped to $O$ (an inversion is,
appropriately enough, it's own inverse) and things start going
bad. For example, what happens when two inversions are composed?
Does this new transformation have two points that don't go
anywhere?

To solve the conundrum we need to extend our plane to include a
point that can be the image of $O$.

The [i]inversive plane[/i] is the standard plane with an
additional [i]point at infinity[/i] $\omega$ added that lies on
every line and is infinitely far from every point. One way to think about this is through stereographic projection.

This alters one of the basic properties of plane geometry. In the
brave new world of the inversive plane every pair of non-parallel
lines intersect in two points and every pair of parallel lines
intersect in one point. This is reminiscent of the properties of
circles and there is indeed a deep connection between lines and
circles in the inversive plane. We call any line or circle in the
inversive plane an [i]inversive circle[/i].

We can now clarify our definition of inversion by defining it on
the inversive plane and mapping $O$ and $\omega$ to each other.

[h4]First properties of inversion[/h4]

The fundamental property of inversion is simply that it maps
inversive circles to inversive circles.

[b]Exercise I1[/b] - Prove this statement. (One can do this using coordinates or by showing that the cross-ratio of four points is preserved by inversion. See below.) 

Find the conditions under which the following occur:[ol]
  [li]A circle is mapped to a circle.[/li]
  [li]A circle is mapped to a line.[/li]
  [li]A line is mapped to a circle.[/li]
  [li]A line is mapped to a line.[/li]
[/ol]

Exercise I1 makes clear the relationship between circles and
lines, and is enough to demonstrate many correspondences between
properties of circles and lines. For example, parallel lines should be considered as
tangent circles.

[h4]Angles under inversion[/h4]

Like reflection, inversion is orientation-reversing but otherwise
preserves angles between lines. At first glance it may not be
clear what that means, since lines don't necessarily end up as
lines. By defining the angle between two circles to be the angle
between their tangent lines that problem is solved and the more
general statement becomes clear: Inversion reverses all angles
between inversive circles.

[b]Exercise I3[/b] - Prove the previous statement. Show that angles (between two circles) are preserved under inversion. More precisely, the angle between two circles is reversed under inversion if we direct angles modulo $\pi$. First consider the case of two lines, and finish the proof by observing that the property of tangency is preserved.

Another possibility is to show the following lemma: Let $C_1$ be an inversive
circle and $C'_1$ its inverse under an inversion with center $O$.
If $P$ is a point on $C_1$ with image $P'$, then the tangent to
$C'_1$ at $P'$ is the reflection of the tangent to $C_1$ at $P$
about the perpendicular bisector of $PP'$.

[b]Exercise I4[/b] - The angle between lines that pass through the
origin seems to be preserved by inversion. Why does this not
contradict the previous exercise? \sk

[b]Exercise I5[/b] - Let $O, A, B$ be collinear. For any point $C$ not on line $AB$, show that $\angle ACB = -\angle A'C'B'$. \sk

[h4]Orthogonal Circles[/h4]

Orthogonal circles have particularly nice properties under
inversion. Because angles are preserved, orthogonal circles are sent to orthogonal circles. Thus any circle orthogonal to the circle of inversion is fixed.

[b]Exercise I6[/b] - If circle $C_1$ is orthogonal to $C$, show that
it is fixed by inversion in $C$. In addition, if $C_1$ and $C_2$
are both orthogonal to $C$ and intersect at $X$ and $Y$, show that
$X$ and $Y$ are inverses in $C$. This is one reason that inversion
is sometimes called [i]reflection in a circle[/i]. Moreover, show that inversion in a circle $\omega$ can be defined as the unique transformation taking circles orthogonal to $\omega$ to themselves and exchanging the inside and outside of $\omega$. Use this to define inversion in a line. \sk

The above exercise allows us to define inversion purely in terms of circles, incidence and orthogonality. Thus inversion may be defined without appealing to the notion of distance.

One failing of inversion is that it doesn't deal well with the
centers of circles. This may seem strange because the circles
themselves are so well preserved under inversion, but
unfortunately the center of a circle is not generally mapped to
the center of it's inverse. (In fact a good counterexample is the circle of inversion itself!) By symmetry, the two centers do line
on a line through the center of inversion, but the distances don't
work out correctly.

One way to get a handle on centers of circles is by observing that inversion in a circle $\omega$ takes a circle $\alpha$ and any pair of inverse points $P, Q$ in $\alpha$ to $\alpha'$ and $P', Q'$, where $P'$ and $Q'$ are inverse in $\alpha'$.

The question of how many degrees of freedom are available in the
set of inversions is a complicated one: the answer is
approximately three. One of the most important degrees of freedom-related
theorems is that there exists an inversion mapping two given
nonintersecting circles to concentric circles. This is
particularly interesting given the previous paragraph and offers
one more way to get a handle on the centers of circles using
inversion. The next few exercises ask you to prove some
degrees-of-freedom-related theorems.

[b]Exercise I7[/b] - Find an inversion that maps two given
nonintersecting circles to concentric circles.

[b]Exercise I8[/b] - Show that for many sets of three circles there
is an inversion which inverts each one to itself. When is this not
true?

[b]Exercise I9[/b] - Show that any three points can be inverted to the vertices of a triangle similar to a given triangle. (Hint: If $A, B, C$ invert to $A', B', C'$ then $\angle BOC=\angle BAC + \angle B'A'C'$.)

[h4]Using Inversion[/h4]

Most of the time, inversion can be used with the
``invert-solve-uninvert'' strategy. By choosing a nice point to
invert about, inconvenient circles can become lines -- this is
known as the "busy point" method. The following problem is a
classic.

[i]Problem[/i] - Cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ is given
in the plane. Find the locus of points $X$ such that the
circumcircles of triangles $ABX$ and $CDX$ are tangent.

[i]Solution[/i] - Invert the diagram about $A$. The
points $B',C',D'$ are collinear and we are looking for points $X'$
such that the line $B'X'$ is tangent to circle $C'D'X'$. But by
power of a point, $B'X'$ is tangent to circle $C'D'X$ if and only
if $B'X'^2 = (B'C')(B'D')$ Thus all such $X'$ lie on a circle
centered at $B'$. The inverse of this circle, and the solution to
the problem, is therefore a circle or line. Since the circle is
orthogonal to line $B'C'D'$, the inverse must be orthogonal to the
circle $ABCD$. Also, since the circle is centered at $B'$, it's
inverse is centered at a point on $AB$. By a similar inversion
about $D$, that center must be on $CD$ as well, and therefore be
centered at the intersection of $AB$ and $CD$. If $AB$ and $CD$
are parallel, the locus is the symmetry line of the figure. \sk

Another common trick is to use inversion to pull far-apart angles
together. Although the procedure may seem magical at first, after
a little practice it will be quite natural.

[i](IMO 1996/2)[/i] - Let $P$ be a point inside
triangle $ABC$ such that
$$\angle APB - \angle ACB = \angle APC - \angle ABC.$$
Let $D$ and $E$ be the incenters of triangles $APB$ and $APC$
respectively. Show that $AP,BD$, and $CE$ meet at a point.

[i]Solution[/i] - We simply need to prove that the
angle bisectors of $\angle ABP$ and $\angle ACP$ hit line $AP$ at
the same point. By the angle bisector theorem, this is equivalent
to the expression
$$\frac{BP}{AB} = \frac{CP}{AC}.$$
The angle constraint is fairly ugly, so we invert about $A$ and
produce some similar triangles, namely $APC$ similar to $AC'P'$,
$APB$ similar to $AB'P'$ and $ABC$ similar to $AC'B'$. Thus
$\angle APB = \angle AB'P'$ and $\angle ACB = \angle AB'C'$
telling us that $\angle C'B'P = \angle AB'P' - \angle AB'C' =
\angle APB - \angle ACB$. Performing similar work on the other
side of the angle constraint, and equating, we get $\angle C'B'P =
\angle PC'B'$. Thus $B'P' = P'C'$ and using the inversive distance
formula, we have \beqa
BP \frac{r^2}{AB \cdot AP} &=& CP \frac{r^2}{AC \cdot AP} \\
\frac{BP}{AB} &=& \frac{CP}{AC} \eeqa which is exactly what we
wished to prove. \sk
