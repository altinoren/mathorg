This lecture focuses on the Abel Summation formula, which is most often useful as a way to take advantage
of unusual given conditions such as ordering or majorization, or simply as a way to put a new look on an
expression. But in addition to learning to use this formula, I want to emphasize good, motivated thinking
for all of these problems. Don’t simply hunt for the time and place to apply Abel Summation; hopefully,
when and if the occasion arises, you’ll recognize it.

## Abel Summation

Let $n$ be a positive integer, and let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$ be two sequences. Then if $S_k = a_1 + \cdots + a_k$, 
\[ \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k = S_n b_n + \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} S_k (b_k - b_{k+1}) \]
\[ = (a_1) (b_1 - b_2) + (a_2)(b_2 - b_3) + \cdots + (a_1 + \cdots + a_{n-1})(b_{n-1} - b_n) + (a_1 + \cdots + a_n)(b_n). \]

This is often called “Summation by Parts” due to its continuous analog, Integration by Parts:

\[ \int f(x) \cdot g'(x) dx = f(x) \cdot g(x) - \int f'(x) \cdot g(x) dx. \]

(Here, differentiation corresponds to differencing and antidifferentiation corresponds to partial sums.) Indeed, the equivalence of (1) and (2) can be established directly: one direction with Riemann sums, and the other with appropriate choice of functions.


**Problem 1.** Do this. 

The following problems can explain the usefulness of this formula better than I could while waving my
hands, so let’s get started.

**Problem 2.** Given two sets of real numbers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n; b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n$, prove that the following two statements are equivalent:  
**(i).** For any numbers $x_1 \leq x_2 \leq \cdots \leq x_n$,  
\[ a_1 x_1 + a_2 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n \leq b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + \cdots + b_n x_n. \]
**(ii).** $a_1 + \cdots + a_n = b_1 + \cdots + b_n$ and $a_1 + \cdots + a_k \geq b_1 + \cdots + b_k$ for each $1 \leq k \leq n$. 


_Proof._ Suppose the first condition is true. Setting $x_i = 1$ for each $i$ gives $\sum a_i \leq \sum b_i$, and similarly setting $x_i = -1$ for each $i$ gives $\sum a_i \geq \sum b_i$, so the sums are equal. Next, for each $k$, setting $x_1 = \cdots + x_k = -1, x_{k+1} = \cdots = x_n = 0$ shows that $a_1 + \cdots + a_k \geq b_1 + \cdots + b_k$ for each $k$, which is exactly the condition in (ii). 

Now suppose (ii) holds, and take any sequence $x_1 \leq \cdots \leq x_n$. Define $A_k = a_1 + a_2 + \cdots + a_k$ and $B_k = b_1 + b_2 + \cdots + b_k$. By Abel Summation, we have 

$\begin{align*}
a_1 x_2 + \cdots + a_n x_n 
&= A(x_1 - x_2) + A_2(x_2 - x_3) + \cdots + A_{n-1}(x_{n-1} - x_n) + A_nx_n \\
&\geq B_1(x_1 - x_2) + B_2(x_2 - x_3) + \cdots + B_{n-1}(x_{n-1} - x_n) + B_n x_n \\
&= b_1 x_1 + \cdots + b_n x_n.
\end{align*}$
