When trying to prove a property about a collection of objects, it is often helpful to consider the object that minimizes or maximizes some function. This technique is called the [i]extremal principle[/i]. We will illustrate this technique with an example. 

[b]Problem 1.[/b] There is a set of points in the plane, such that each point in the set is the midpoint of some two other points in the set. Show that this set is infinite. 

[b]Solution.[/b] Suppose for the sake of contradiction that this set is finite. Consider any two points $A$ and $B$ in the set whose distances from one another are maximal. Suppose that $B$ is the midpoint of $C$ and $D$, where $C$ and $D$ are points in the set. Since $\angle CBA + \angle ABD = 180^{\circ}$, one of $\angle ABD$ and $\angle CBA$ is at least $90^{\circ}$. If $\angle ABD \geq 90^{\circ}$, then $AD$ is the longest side of $\triangle ABD$, and thus longer than $AB$, so the length $AB$ is not maximal. If $\angle CBA \geq 90^{\circ}$, then $AC$ is the longest side of $\triangle ABC$, and thus longer than $AB$, so the length $AB$ is not maximal. This is a contradiction, so the set must be infinite.
