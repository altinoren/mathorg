Many of the following problems are selected from the Putnam and Beyond by Gelca and Andreescu.

[li]{{{(Gelca & Andreescu, P&B, p.304) Prove the combinatorial identity $$\sum_{k=1}^nk{n \choose k}^2=n{2n-1 \choose n-1}.$$}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Gelca & Andreescu, P&B, p.303) Find in closed form

  [li]{{{(France-1985) Show that for any positive integers $p$ and $q$,

  [li]each pair of students is in exactly one club,[/li]
  [li]for each student and each society, the student is in exactly one club of the society,[/li]
  [li]each club has an odd number of students; in addition, a club with $2m + 1$ students $(m > 0)$ is in exactly $m$ societies.[/li]
