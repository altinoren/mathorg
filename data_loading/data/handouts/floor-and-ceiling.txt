1.  [[[A large rectangle in the plane is partitioned into smaller
    rectangles, each of which has either integer height or integer width
    (or both). Prove that the large rectangle also has this property.]]]

2.  [[[Given positive integers $a,b,$ and $m$ with
    $\gcd(a,b)=1$. Let $A$ be a nonempty set of positive
    integers such that for every positive integer $n$ either
    $an\in A$ or $bn\in A$. Determine the minimum number of
    elements the set $A\cap\{1,2,\ldots,m\}$ can have.]]]

3.  [[[In the Cartesian coordinate plan define the strip
    \[S_n=\{(x,y):n\leq x< n+1\}\] for every integer $n$. Assume
    that each strip $S_n$ is colored either red or blue, and let
    $a$ and $b$ be two distinct positive integers. Prove that
    there exists a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$ such
    that its vertices have the same color.]]]
