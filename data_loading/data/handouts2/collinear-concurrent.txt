[b]Abstract.[/b] Some tips on proving that lines are concurrent or points are collinear.

There are many, many ways to prove that lines are concurrent and points are collinear. Here are some ways, but be aware that there are many others (like, for instance, projective geometry in general).

[h2]Collinearity[/h2]
[h3]Menelaus' theorem[/h3]
Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $P$, $Q$, $R$ be points on lines $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Then $P$, $Q$ and $R$ are collinear if and only if
$$\frac{BP}{PC}\cdot \frac{CQ}{QA}\cdot \frac{AR}{RB} = -1.$$

[h3]Pappus' theorem[/h3]
Let $A_1,A_2,A_3$ be points in a line $r$ and $B_1,B_2,B_3$ points in a line $s$. Then $A_1B_2\cap A_2B_1$, $A_1B_3\cap A_3B_1$ and $A_2B_3\cap A_3B_2$ are collinear.

[h3]Pascal's theorem[/h3]
Let $ABCDEF$ be a hexagon inscribed in a circle. Then the intersections of opposite sides $AB\cap DE$, $BC\cap EF$ and $CD\cap FA$ are collinear. The hexagon doesn't need to be convex, and degenerate cases (for example, $A=B$) are allowed (in the mentioned case, $AB = AA$ is the tangent line through $A$).

[h2]Concurrency[/h2]
[h3]Ceva's theorem[/h3]
Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $P$, $Q$, $R$ be points on lines $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Then $AP$, $BQ$ and $CR$ are concurrent if and only if
$$\frac{BP}{PC}\cdot \frac{CQ}{QA}\cdot \frac{AR}{RB} = 1.$$

This also holds if some points are on extensions of sides.

[h3]Trig Ceva[/h3]
Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $P$, $Q$, $R$ be points on lines $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Then $AP$, $BQ$ and $CR$ are concurrent if and only if
$$\frac{\sin\angle BAP}{\sin\angle PAC}\cdot \frac{\sin\angle CBQ}{\sin\angle QBA}\cdot \frac{\sin\angle ACR}{\sin\angle RCB} = 1.$$

This also holds if some points are on extensions of sides.

[h3]Brianchon's theorem[/h3]
Let $ABCDEF$ be a hexagon circumscribed to a circle. Then the lines connecting opposite vertices, that is, $AD$, $BE$ and $CF$, are concurrent. The hexagon doesn't need to be convex, and degenerate cases are allowed.

[h3]Radical axes and center[/h3]
Let $\Gamma_1$, $\Gamma_2$ and $\Gamma_3$. Then the radical axes of $\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2$, $\Gamma_2,\Gamma_3$ and $\Gamma_3,\Gamma_1$ are either all parallel or concurrent at the radical center of the three circles.

[h2]Collinearity and concurrency[/h2]
[h3]Desargues' theorem[/h3]
Let $A_1B_1C_1$ and $A_2B_2C_2$ be triangles in space (yes, this works in 3D!). Then the lines connecting corresponding vertices $A_1A_2$, $B_1B_2$, $C_1C_2$ are concurrent (or all parallel) if and only if the intersections of corresponding sides $A_1B_1\cap A_2B_2$, $A_1C_1\cap A_2C_2$ and $B_1C_1\cap B_2C_2$ are collinear.

[h3]Homothety[/h3]
[ul][li]If two diagrams are homothetic then all lines connecting corresponding points are concurrent at the homothety center.[/li]
  [li]In a homothety, the homothety center and two corresponding points are collinear.[/li][/ul]

[h3]Composition of homotheties[/h3]
If $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ are homotheties with center $O_1,O_2$ respectively and ratios $k_1,k_2$ respectively ($k_1,k_2$ might be negative), $k_1k_2\neq 1$, then the composition $\sigma_1\circ\sigma_2$ is a homothety with center $O$ and ratio $k_1k_2$, and $O$, $O_1$ and $O_2$ are collinear. If $k_1k_2 = 1$, then $\sigma_1\circ\sigma_2$ is a translation.

This can be proved via Desargues' theorem. Try it!

[h3]Inversion[/h3]
As much as in homothety:
[ul][li]If two diagrams are inverse then all lines connecting corresponding points are concurrent at the inversion center.[/li]
  [li]In an inversion, the inversion center and two corresponding points are collinear.[/li][/ul]

[h3]Some final hints[/h3]
[ul][li]Guessing the common point of concurrent lines or the line passing through collinear points can be really helpful. Another good reason to make good, big diagrams.[/li]
  [li]Any concurrency problem is a collinearity problem: just prove that the intersection $P$ of two of these lines lies on the other line; if this line is defined by two points $A$ and $B$, then you have to prove that $A$, $B$ and $P$ are collinear.[/li]
  [li]Good ol' angle chasing is helpful as well![/li][/ul]
