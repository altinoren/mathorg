[h2]Bijections, surjections, injections...[/h2]

 Many combinatorial problems can be solved by finding the right bijection.  

[b]Definition 1.[/b] A [i]bijection[/i], or [i]bijective map[/i], is a mapping between the elements of two sets $A$ and $B$, in such a way that each element $x$ of $A$ maps to a unique element $z$ of $B$, and vice versa.

 Alternatively, a bijection is a function that is both:
  [ul][li][i]Injective[/i], or [i]one-to-one[/i], which means that if $x$ and $y$ both map to $z$ then $x=y$, and[/li]
    [li][i]Surjective[/i], or [i]onto[/i], meaning that every element $z$ of $B$ is mapped to by some $x$ in $A$.[/li][/ul]

[h2]Useful properties[/h2]

Here are [b]three very important facts[/b] to remember about bijections:
 [ol]
  [li]If there is a bijection between finite sets $A$ and $B$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements.[/li]
  [li]If $f:A\to B$ has an inverse $g:B\to A$, that is, $f(g(b))=b$ and $g(f(a))=a$ for all $a\in A$ and $b\in B$, then $f$ is a bijection.[/li]
  [li]"Bijection between" is an [i]equivalence relation:[/i]
    [ul][li](Reflexive.) For any set $A$, there is a bijection from $A$ to $A$ (namely, the identity map).[/li]
    [li](Symmetric.) If there is a bijection $f:A\to B$, then there is a bijection $g=f^{-1}:B\to A$.[/li]
    [li](Transitive.) If there is a bijection $f:A\to B$, and a bijection $g:B\to C$, then the composite map $g\circ f:A\to C$ is a bijection from $A$ to $C$.[/li][/ul][/li]
[/ol]

We can use these principles to help us count the elements of a set: if we wish to find $|A|$ (the number of elements in $A$) and there is a bijection from $A$ to a set $B$ whose elements are easy to count, then we can compute $|B|$ instead since $|A|=|B|$.

  We can also prove two integers $n$ and $m$ are equal by showing they are the number of elements in a pair of sets $A$ and $B$ having a bijection between them.

[b]Example 1.[/b] Prove that $$\sum_{k=0}^n k\binom{n}{k}=n2^{n-1}.$$

There are many ways of going about proving this.  One way is to find a set $A$ that the left hand side counts, and a set $B$ that the right hand side counts, and find a bijection between $A$ and $B$.  This method is sometimes called [i]counting in two ways[/i].

The left hand side is the number of ways we can choose a subset of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ having any size $k$, and then choosing one of those $k$ to be special.  Thus, the left hand side is the cardinality of the set $$A=\{(S,e): S\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,n\}, e\in S\}.$$  On the other hand, the right hand side is the number of ways of choosing an element $b\in \{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ (there are $n$ ways to do this) and then choosing a subset $T$ of the remaining numbers.  Thus, the right hand side is the cardinality of $$B=\{(a,T):1\le a\le n, T\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,n\}\setminus \{a\}\}.$$  Finally, there is a bijection between $A$ and $B$: define $f:A\to B$ by $f(S,e)=(e,S\setminus\{e\})$.  It has an inverse $g(a,T)=(T\cup \{a\},a)$, and so $f$ is a bijection.
