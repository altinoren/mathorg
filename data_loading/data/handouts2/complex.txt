[h2]How to Use Complex Numbers[/h2]

In this handout, we will identify the two dimensional real plane with the one dimensional complex plane.  To each point in vector form, we associate the corresponding complex number.  

[b]Note 1.[/b] Throughout this handout, we use a lowercase letter to denote the complex number that represents the point labeled by the corresponding uppercase letter.

This allows us to compute geometric transformations easily.  Sometimes, this can lead to solutions that are quite elegant:

[b]Problem 2.[/b] {{{(TST 2006/6) Let $ABC$ be a triangle.  Triangles $PAB$ and $QAC$ are constructed outside of triangle $ABC$ such that $AP = AB$ and $AQ = AC$ and $\angle BAP = \angle CAQ$.  Segments $BQ$ and $CP$ meet at $R$.  Let $O$ be the circumcenter of triangle $BCR$.  Prove that $AO \perp PQ$.}}}

When synthetic approaches have failed, we can use computation with complex numbers:

[b]Problem 3.[/b] {{{(MOP 2010) In cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$, diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ meet at $E$, and lines $AD$ and $BC$ meet at $F$.  Let $G$ and $H$ be the midpoints of sides $AB$ and $CD$, respectively.  Prove that $EF$ is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle $EGH$.}}}

[b]Problem 4.[/b] {{{(USAMO 2012) Let $P$ be a point in the plane of $\triangle ABC$, and $\gamma$ a
line passing through $P$. Let $A'$, $B'$, $C'$ be the points where
the reflections of lines $PA$, $PB$, $PC$ with respect to $\gamma$
intersect lines $BC$, $AC$, $AB$, respectively. Prove that $A'$,
$B'$, $C'$ are collinear.}}}

There are a number of general principles for this:
[ul][li]To solve a problem using complex numbers, the general approach is reduce the desired statement to a calculation.  This can be done in a number of ways: 
[ol][/li]
  [li]Checking a condition (for parallel lines, cyclic quadrilaterals, collinearity) or checking a claim about angles or distances given in the problem.  In this case, you should just calculate and then check the condition.[/li]
  [li]Reducing the claim to the fact that some two points are the same.  This is usually used to show concurrency or collinearity.  The calculation can sometimes be reduced a bit in this case; if the problem involves a triangle $ABC$ and asks to show that some lines $\ell_A, \ell_B, \ell_C$ defined symmetrically in terms of $A, B, C$ are concurrent, then it is enough to show that the coordinates of $\ell_A \cap \ell_B$ are symmetric in $a, b, c$.[/li]
[/ol]
[li]Before checking any conditions, it is important to set up a good set of variable points to compute with.  Some pointers:
[ol][/li]
  [li]If there is a circle that figures prominently in the problem, you should set this to be the unit circle so that conjugates of points are also explicitly computable.  In particular, if a triangle or quadrilateral is circumscribed rather than inscribed, take the points of tangency as your variables.[/li]
  [li]Any synthetic observations you make (most commonly, finding a spiral similarity) might allow you to reduce the number of unknown variables.[/li]
[/ol]
[li]Sometimes, solutions will involve a fair amount of algebraic manipulation.  It might seem obvious, but you try to keep the algebra as clean as possible. I recommend the following: (1) Whenever possible, factor. (2) Keep your terms homogeneous so you can spot errors easily. (3) Before you begin, try to estimate the number of terms you will end up with, and prepare accordingly.  Everyone has a personal system for dealing with large expressions; you should find what works for you.[/li][/ul]

[h2]When to Use Complex Numbers[/h2]

There are a number of signs that suggest a problem can be approached using complex numbers:
[ul][li]There is one primary circle in the diagram.  If this is the case, you can set this to be the unit circle, and calculate all other points in terms of some values on the circle.  In particular, the common formulas will not contain conjugates, allowing for simpler manipulations.[/li]
  [li]A small number of points is sufficient to define the diagram. In particular, if the coordinates of each point in the diagram may be computed easily, then solving the problem with complex numbers should be simple.  This most often occurs with a cyclic complete quadrilateral.[/li][/ul]

Perhaps more important is when [b]NOT[/b] to use complex numbers. Do not use complex numbers if:
[ul][li]You have just started working on a problem.  Complex numbers should only be a method of last resort, and you should almost always try synthetic approaches first.  Regardless of what type of approach you are trying, it is almost always essential that you make some synthetic observations before plunging into calculation.[/li]
  [li]The problem involves a large number of circles.  The condition for cyclic points is rarely very useful as a given, so the extra circle information will be quite difficult to use.[/li]
  [li]There are ``too many'' steps in the calculation.  Each additional layer of construction will add to the number of terms that you need to deal with, and at some point, it will become impossible handle.  After using this method a couple times, you will gradually see what your limit is.  Before using complex numbers, make sure the number of terms will not exceed this![/li][/ul]

[h2]Useful Facts[/h2]

Below are some useful facts. You should be able to derive these easily on your own, and you might want to prove some of the more complicated ones on an actual olympiad solution.  If you plan on using complex numbers as a computational approach frequently, you will likely want to memorize the more common formulas here.	

[b]Fact 1.[/b] A complex number $z$ is real iff $z = \bar{z}$ and is pure imaginary iff $z = - \bar{z}$.

[b]Fact 2.[/b] For a complex number $z$ on the unit circle, we have $\bar{z} = 1 / z$.

[b]Fact 3.[/b] A spiral similarity $\phi$ about a point $A$ takes the form 
\[
\phi(z) = c \cdot (z - a) + a
\]
for some complex constant $c$.

[b]Fact 4.[/b] For [i]any[/i] points $A, B, C, D$, we have:
[ul][li]$AB \parallel CD \iff \displaystyle{\frac{a - b}{c - d}}$ is real[/li]
[li]$ABC$ collinear $\iff \displaystyle{\frac{a - b}{b - c}}$ is real[/li]
  [li]$AB \perp CD \iff \displaystyle{\frac{a - b}{c - d}}$ is imaginary[/li]
  [li]$ABCD$ is cyclic $\iff \displaystyle{\left.\frac{b - a}{c - a} \right/ \frac{b - d}{c - d}}$ is real[/li][/ul]

[b]Fact 5.[/b] Angles $\angle ABC$ and $\angle XYZ$ are equal iff $\displaystyle{\left.\frac{a - b}{c - b}\right/\frac{x-y}{z-y}}$ is real.

[b]Fact 6.[/b] For points $A, B, C, D$ [i]on the unit circle[/i], we have:
[ul][li]the equation of chord $AB$ is $z = a + b - ab \bar{z}$[/li]
  [li]the intersection of chords $AB$ and $CD$ is $\displaystyle{\frac{ab(c+d) - cd (a + b)}{ab - cd}}$[/li]
  [li]the equation of the tangent at $A$ is $z = 2a - a^2 \bar{z}$[/li]
  [li]the intersection of the tangents at $A$ and $B$ is $\frac{2ab}{a+b}$[/li][/ul]

[b]Fact 7.[/b] For a triangle $ABC$ inscribed in the unit circle, we have:
[ul][li]the centroid is given by $g = \frac{a + b + c}{3}$[/li]
  [li]the orthocenter is given by $h = a+b+c$[/li][/ul]

[b]Fact 8.[/b] For a chord $AB$ on the unit circle, the projection of any point $Z$ onto $AB$ is $\frac{1}{2} (a + b + z - ab \bar{z})$

[b]Fact 9.[/b] If $ABC$ is a triangle inscribed in the unit circle, there exist $u, v, w$ such that $a = u^2$, $b = v^2$, $c = w^2$, and $-uv, -vw, -wu$ are the midpoints of the arcs $\widehat{AB}$, $\widehat{BC}$, and $\widehat{CA}$ which do not contain $C$, $A$, and $B$.
