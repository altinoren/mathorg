[h2]Ways to Solve Recurrences[/h2]

[h3]What is a Recurrence?[/h3]
A recurrence is an equation which defines terms in a sequence based on earlier terms. Often times the first few terms (bases cases) will be defined explicitly. Many combinatorial problems are easier to solve by first finding the recurrence and then using it to find the answer. 

[h3]Make a Guess! (and Then Check!)[/h3]
Many times your intuition will give you a reasonable guess at the solution to the recurrence. 

Often times in it's original form the recurrence may not give you any ideas.  So, you may want to try and give yourself some idea what is going on. A good start is to write out the first few terms and see if they are a sequence you are familiar with (i.e. squares Fibonacci).  Another technique is to try are to rewrite the recurrence by simplifying it. One way to do this is to take differences of the expression for $a_n$ and the expression for $a_{n+1}$. Another approach is to substitute one equation into another. 

[h3]Linear Recurrences[/h3]
A linear recurrence has each term look like $ca_n$ where $c$ is a constant. So they can be written as:
$$c_0a_n+c_1a_{n+1}+\dots+c_ka_{n+k}=0$$
In this case we now guess that $a_n=x^n$ where $x>0$. Plugging this in we get the characteristic polynomial:
$$c_0x^n+c_1x^{n+1}+\dots+c_kx^{n+k}=0$$
$$c_0+c_1x+\dots+c_kx^{k}=0$$

Now we just have a polynomial and we can solve for it's roots. Let the roots be $r_1, \dots r_k$ (and for now we assume that the roots are distinct). Now we know that any solution to the recurrence looks like:
$$a_n=\sum_{i=1}^k b_i r_i^n$$
using the base cases we can solve for $b_i$ explicitly. 

If $r_i$ is a root with multiplicity $m$, then we also have to consider that $n^jr_i^n$ are terms in the recurrence where $j <m$. 

Before we assumed that the recurrence was homogeneous (the constant term is zero). In the case, where the recurrence is not homogeneous it will have the form:
$$c_0a_n+c_1a_{n+1}+\dots+c_ka_{n+k}=C$$
The solution to this will be the same as before just shifted by a constant.

[h3]Generating Functions[/h3]
An ordinary generating function of the sequence $a_0,a_1, \dots$ is the power series defined by:
$$\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_ix^i$$

The main generating function to remember is the one for the sequence of all 1's:
$$\frac{1}{1-x}=1+x+x^2+x^3+\dots$$

We can substitute the generating function into our recurrence to solve for the generating function. Once we have solved for the generating function we want to use partial fraction decomposition to break the generating function into parts we understand. Partial fraction decomposition involves breaking the function into pieces of the form $\frac{c}{(1-kx)^n}$.  

[h2]Examples[/h2]

[h3]Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences[/h3]
You are probably most familiar seeing a arithmetic sequence written in the form $a_n=a+dn$. It can also be written as a recurrence where $a_0=a$ and $a_n=a_{n-1}+d$. Likewise a geometric sequence can be written either as $g_n=ar^n$ or as $g_0=a$ and $g_n=rg_{n-1}$. 

[h3]Towers of Hanoi[/h3]

In the game Towers of Hanoi, there are three rods and $n$ discs of distinct sizes. The discs start on the first rod sorted by size with the largest on the bottom. The goal of the game is to move all the discs from the first rod to the third rod. The only moves allowed are to move one disc from one rod to any other rod as long as it is not placed on a smaller disc. What is the minimum number of moves required?

We will let $h_n$ be the minimum number of moves required when there are $n$ discs. Clearly $h_1=1$ as we need at least move to get the disc from the first rod to third disc, and we can do it in one move. Now for $n \geq 2$ we will consider what the largest disc must do. It must have all the $n-1$ discs on top of it moved from on top of it to the second rod so that it may be moved to the third rod. Then all the $n-1$ discs must be moved back on top of it. So we get the following recurrence:
$$h_n=2h_{n-1}+1$$
If we solve for the first few terms in the sequence we get $1,3,7,15,\dots$. Now one might guess that $h_n=2^n-1$, this can be verified by plugging it into the recurrence and checking the base case. 

[h3]The Fibonacci Sequence[/h3]
The Fibonacci sequence is defined to start as $F_0=0,F_1=1$ and any term is the sum of the two previous terms; $F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_n$. What is the explicit formula for the Fibonacci numbers?

Finding the characteristic polynomial we get $x^2=x+1$. The roots of this are $\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2},\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Now we know:
$$F_n=c_1\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n+c_2\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n$$
Solving for $c_1, c_2$ with the initial constraints we get that $c_1+c_2=0$ and $c_1\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}+c_2\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}=1$. So we get that $c_1=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$ and $c_2=\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}$. Therefore the Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as
$$F_n=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n+\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^n$$

[h3]The Catalan Numbers[/h3]
The Catalan numbers $C_n$ count the number of ways to properly arrange $n$ open parenthesis ``(`` and $n$ close parenthesis ``)``. For example, ()()(()) and (()())are a proper arrangements whereas )(())( and ())(() are not. 

The recursive formula for the Catalan numbers is $C_0=1$ and $C_{n+1}=\sum_{i=0}^n C_iC_{n-i}$. We can use generating functions to solve for the explicit form. Let $C(x)$ be the generating function for the Catalan numbers. The sum here resembles a convolution of two sequences (the product of two generating functions) in this case the product is simply the convolution of $C(x)$ with itself. Putting in a $x^{n+1}$ term on both sides we get:
$$C_{n+1}x^{n+1}=x\sum_{i=0}^n C_ix^i C_{n-i}x^{n-i}$$
Now we will sum over all possible $n$ and then plug in $C(x)$. 
$$\sum_{n=0}^\infty C_{n+1}x^{n+1}=x\sum_{n=0}^\infty\sum_{i=0}^n C_ix^i C_{n-i}x^{n-i}$$
$$C(x)-C_0=xC(x)C(x)$$
$$xC(x)^2-C(x)+1=0$$
Solving for $C(x)$ we get $\frac{1\pm\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$. We know $C(0)=1$, therefore we know the correct form is $\frac{1-\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$. Now we can expand the square root using binomial coefficients. 
$$\sqrt{1-4x}=(1-4x)^{1/2}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-4x)^n \binom{1/2}{n}$$
$$=\sum_{n=0}^\infty (-4x)^n \frac{(1/2)(-1/2)\dots (3-2n)/2}{n!}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty -(4x)^n \frac{1(3)(5)\dots(2n-3)}{2^n n!}$$
$$=\sum_{n=0}^\infty -x^n 4^n\frac{(2n-2)!}{2^n n! 2^{n-1} (n-1)!}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty -x^n \frac{2}{n}\frac{(2n-2)!}{(n-1)! (n-1)!}$$
$$=\sum_{n=0}^\infty -x^n \frac{2}{n}\binom{2n-2}{n-1}$$
If we plug this into the expression for $C(x)$ we get:
$$C(x)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty x^{n-1} \frac{1}{n}\binom{2n-2}{n-1}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^{n} \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$$
Therefore the explicit formula for the Catalan numbers is $C_n=\frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n}$. The first few terms of the Catalan numbers are 1,1,2,5,14,42.
