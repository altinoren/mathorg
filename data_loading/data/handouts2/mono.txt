  [li]{{{Let $R$ denote the set $\{a+bi|a,b,\in\mathbb Z\}$ of Gaussian integers, which is closed under addition and multiplication.  If $\alpha,\beta\in R$ and if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ share no factors other than $\pm 1$ or $\pm i$, prove that there are elements $\gamma,\delta\in R$ with $\alpha\gamma+\beta\delta =1$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $\omega$ be a primitive cube root of unity, and let $R$ denote the set $\{a+b\omega|a,b\in\mathbb Z\}$.  Notice that $R$ is closed under addition and multiplication.  If $\alpha,\beta\in R$ and if $\alpha$ and $\beta$ share no factors other than $\pm 1$ or $\pm 1 \pm' \omega$, prove that there are elements $\gamma,\delta\in R$ with $\alpha\gamma + \beta\delta = 1$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $\mathbb{Q}[x]$ denote the set of polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{Q}$.  If $f,g\in \mathbb{Q}[x]$ share no factors of degree greater than zero, prove that there exist polynomials $a,b\in\mathbb{Q}[x]$ with $af+bg=1$ (as polynomials).}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(USAMO 2003/6) At the vertices of a regular hexagon are written six nonnegative integers whose sum is 2003.  Bert is allowed to make moves of the following form: he may pick a vertex and replace the number written there by the absolute value of the difference between the numbers written at the two neighboring vertices.  Prove that Bert can make a sequence of moves, after which the number 0 appears at all six vertices.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(IMO 1986/3) To each vertex of a regular pentagon an integer is assigned in such a way that the sum of all five numbers is positive.  If three consecutive vertices are assigned the numbers $x,y,z$ respectively and $y<0$ then the following operation is allowed: the numbers $x,y,z$ are replaced by the $x+y,-y,z+y$ respectively.  Such an operation is performed repeatedly as long as one of the five numbers is negative.  Determine whether this procedure necessarily comes to an end after a finite number of steps.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(USAMO 1994/2) The sides of a 99-gon are initially colored so that consecutive sides are red, blue, red, blue, $\ldots$, red, blue, yellow.  We make a sequence of modifications in the coloring, changing the color of one side at a time to one of the three given colors under the constraint that no two adjacent sides may be the same color.  By making a sequence of such modifications, is it possible to arrive at the coloring in which consecutive sides are red, blue, red, blue, $\ldots$, red, yellow, blue?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Russia 1995) Two positive integers are written on the board.  The following operation is repeated: if $a<b$ are the numbers on the board, then $a$ is erased and $ab/(b-a)$ is written in its place.  At some point the numbers on the board are equal.  Prove that they are again positive integers.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{We consider the lattice of ordered pairs $(a,b)$ where $a$ and $b$ are nonnegative integers.  Initially, we color the point $(0,0)$ and leave the other lattice points blank.  Whenever a colored vertex $v$ has two vertices to its right or two vertices above it which are uncolored, we may color those vertices and erase the color on $v$; we also allow the reverse of this move.  After a sequence of such moves, can we reach a stage where only $(1,0)$ is colored?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{On an infinite square lattice grid in the plane, we have shaded the six first quadrant squares with their centers closest to the origin.  There are pawns on some of the squares in the lattice.  If the neighboring right and above squares are empty, then we can remove the pawn and place one pawn in each of the two neighboring squares.  The goal is to have all the six shaded squares free of pawns.  Is it possible to reach the goal if we begin with pawns in each of the six shaded squares?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{An infinite sequence of decimal digits begins with $010101\cdots$.  Each digit after the sixth is the last digit of the sum of the previous 6 digits.  Does the subsequence $101010$ occur anywhere in the sequence?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given an initial sequence $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ of real numbers, we perform a series of steps, replacing the sequence $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ with \[|x_1-a|,\ldots,|x_n-a|\] for some real number $a$.  Prove that one can always reach a sequence of zeroes with a series of such operations, and find (with proof) the minimum number of steps necessary to get there (depending on the initial sequence).}}}[/li]
