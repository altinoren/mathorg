[h2]Trees[/h2]
There are many equivalent definitions of trees. We let $n$ denote the number of vertices. Some definitions of trees are given below:
[ul][li]A connected graph without cycles[/li]
  [li]A minimal connected graph (removing any edge disconnects the graph)[/li]
  [li]A maximal graph without cycles (adding any edge causes a cycle)[/li]
  [li]A graph with $n-1$ edges without a cycle.[/li]
  [li]A connected graph with $n-1$ edges.[/li][/ul]

[i]Cayley's Theorem[/i] There are $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees of a $K_n$ with labeled vertices. 

[ol]
[li]{{{Given a spanning tree of graph $G$, we are allowed to remove an edge from the tree and insert and edge from the graph $G$ so that a new spanning tree is created. Show that every spanning tree can be reached by a succession of such operations.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Some pairs of the 100 towns in a country are connected by two-way flights. It is given that one can reach any town from any other by a sequence of flights. Prove that one can fly and visit every town, with a total of at most 198 flights. (Can you get it down to 196?)}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Alice and Bob play the following game on a given simple connected graph $G$. Alice starts the game. At each of her turns, she deletes an edge of $G$. Following Alice, Bob fixed an edge at each of his turns. A fixed edge can not be deleted. Bob wins if he builds a spanning tree of $G$, otherwise Alice wins. Show that if $G$ has two edge-disjoint spanning trees, then Bob wins the game (In fact, this is also the necessary condition).}}}[/li]
[/ol]
[h2]Hamiltonian Cycles[/h2]
A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle which visits all the vertices in a graph. A graph is called Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian cycle.

[i]Dirac's Theorem[/i] A graph with $n$ vertices, where each vertex has degree $\geq n/2$, has a Hamiltonian cycle. 

Dirac's Theorem can be strengthened slightly to:

[i]Ore's Theorem[/i] A graph with $n$ vertices is Hamiltonian if for every pair of non-adjacent vertices the sum of their degrees is at least $n$. 
[ol]
[li]{{{Show Dirac's Theorem.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Show that if for all $i \leq n/2$ there are at most $i-1$ vertices of degree $i$ or less then there is a Hamiltonian cycle.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{An $n$-cube is a cube in $n$ dimensions. A cube in one dimension is a line segment; in two
dimensions,it's a square,in three, a normal cube, and in general,to go to the next dimension,
a copy of the cube is made and all corresponding vertices are connected. If we consider the cube to be composed of the vertices and edges only, show that every $n$-cube has a Hamiltonian cycle.}}}[/li]

[h2]Coloring[/h2]

A proper coloring of the graph is a coloring of the vertices such that the no two adjacent vertices have the same color. The minimum number of colors to properly color a graph $G$ is called the [i]chromatic number[/i] of $G$, and is sometimes written as $\chi(G)$. 

Let $\Delta(G)$ be the maximum degree of $G$. Clearly, $\Delta(G)+1$ is an upper bound on $\chi(G)$. A vertex can have at most $\Delta(G)$ different colors adjacent to it, so with $\Delta(G)+1$ colors we can always pick a color for each vertex no matter what order we color the vertices in. In most cases, the bound on chromatic number is actually $\Delta(G)$. 

[i]Brook's Theorem[/i] If $G$ is a connected graph then $\chi(G) \leq \Delta(G)$ unless $G$ is a complete graph or an odd cycle. 

[i]The Four Color Theorem[/i] Any planar graph can be colored with at most four colors. (Interestingly, this proof required computers to do a bunch of case checking and there is currently no proof that doesn't require checking a few hundred cases.) 


[ol]
[li]{{{Given a graph $G$, prove that there exists a polynomial $\chi_G(x)$ such that, $\chi_G(k)$ is the number of ways to properly color the vertices of $G$ in $k$ colors.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Prove that every planar graph can be properly colored with at most 5 colors (without using the four color theorem).}}}[/li]
[/ol]

[h2]Problems[/h2]
[ol]
[li]{{{Prove that every graph with average degree $d$ contains a subgraph in which every vertex has degree at least $d/2$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Prove that any two longest paths in a connected graph have a vertex in common.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(BAMO 2004) Given a positive integer $n$, find the smallest $e$ such that every graph on $n$ vertices with $e$ edges is connected.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(BMC, 2006) There are 2008 managers in a boring corporate meeting. Each manager has exactly one boss, who may or not be among the other managers present at the meeting. A manager is [i]powerful[/i] if he is the boss of at least four other managers at the meeting. What is the maximum possible number of powerful managers?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $G$ be a graph where all degrees are even. Find a way to trace out an Eulerian circuit on $G$ by following a simple rule. (examples of a simple rule (but which don't work): always go to the vertex with highest remaining degree, or always go to a vertex which has been visited the least number of times.)}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given a graph $G$, we start modifying it as follows: In each round, as long as $G$ is cyclic, pick an arbitrary cycle of $G$, e.g. $C$, and remove all the edges of $C$ from $G$. Then, add a new vertex to the graph, e.g. $v_C$, and connect $v_C$ to all the vertices of $C$ (note that the newly added vertex can be on the cycles that we pick in the next rounds). Show that regardless of the choice of cycles, $G$ becomes a forest (collection of trees) after a finite number of rounds}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{A connected graph with at least two vertices has the property that, if any $k$ edges are removed, it is still connected. Prove that any two vertices $v, w$, there are at least $k+1$ edge disjoint paths connecting $v$ to $w$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given a connected graph $G$, find the necessary and sufficient conditions for coloring its edges with two colors, black and white, such that for any vertex, both colors occur among its edges.
([i]Hint: This is impossible to do in an odd cycle[/i])}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{A complete graph on $6n$ vertices has its edges colored red and blue. Prove that we can find $n$ triangles, all of whose vertices are distinct, and with all $3n$ of their edges the same color.}}}[/li]
