  [li]{{{Let $n$ be a given integer greater than $2$.  We wish to label
    each side and each diagonal of a regular $n$-gon $P_1P_2\cdots P_n$
    with a positive integer less than or equal to $r$ so that
   [ol][li]every integer between $1$ and $r$ occurs as a label;[/li]
    [li]in each triangle $P_iP_jP_k$ two of the labels are equal
    and greater than the third.[/li][/ol]
  Given these conditions:
   [ol][li]Determine the largest positive integer $r$ for which this
    can be done.[/li]
    [li]For that maximum value of $r$, how many such labelings are
    there?[/li][/ol]}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{In an $m\times n$ rectangular board of $mn$ unit squares, two
    squares are [i]adjacent[/i] if they share a common edge.  A
    [i]path[/i] is a sequence of squares in which any two consecutive
    squares are adjacent.  Each square of the board can be colored black
    or white.  Let $N$ denote the number of coloring schemes of the
    board such that there exists at least one black path from the left
    edge of the board to its right edge, and let $M$ denote the number
    of coloring schemes in which there exist at least two
    non-intersecting black paths from the left edge to the right edge.
    Prove that $N^2\geq M\cdot 2^{mn}$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{A $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a coloring of its vertices
    using $k$ possible colors such that the end points of any edge have
    different colors.  We say a graph $G$ is [i]uniquely
      $k$-colorable[/i] if on the one hand it has a $k$-coloring, but on
    the other hand there do not exist vertices $u$ and $v$ such that $u$
    and $v$ have the same color in one $k$-coloring and $u$ and $v$ have
    different colors in another $k$-coloring.  Prove that if a graph $G$
    with $n$ vertices ($n\geq 3$) is uniquely $3$-colorable, then it has
    at least $2n-3$ edges.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_8$ be eight distinct points on the
    circumference of a circle such that no three chords, each joining a
    pair of points, are concurrent.  Every four of the eight points form
    a quadrilateral which is called a [b]quad[/b].  If two chords, each
    joining a pair of the eight points, intersect, the point of
    intersection is called a [b]bullet[/b].  Suppose some of the bullets
    are colored red.  For each pair $(i,j)$, with $1\leq i<j\leq 8$, let
    $r(i,j)$ be the number of quads containing $a_i,a_j$ as vertices and
    whose diagonals intersect at a red bullet.  Determine the smallest
    positive integer $n$ such that it is possible to color $n$ of the
    bullets red so that $r(i,j)$ is a constant for all pairs $(i,j)$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Points $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$, with no three collinear, are given
    in the plane.  Each point is colored in eaither red or blue.  A
    nonempty set $S$ of the triangles with $P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_n$ as their
    vertices is called [i]good[/i] if for every pair of segments
    $P_iP_j$ and $P_uP_v$, the number of triangles in $S$ containing
    side $P_iP_j$ is equal to the number of triangles in $S$ containing
    side $P_uP_v$. A triangle is called [i]monochromatic[/i] if all its
    vertices are of the same color.  Determine the minimum value of $n$
    such that there are always two monochromatic triangles in any good set.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{There is a set of $n$ coins with distinct integer weights
    $w_1,w_2,\ldots,w_n$.  It is known that if any coin with weight
    $w_k$, $1\leq k\leq n$, is removed from the set, the remaining coins
    can be split into two groups of the same weight.  (The number of
    coins in the two groups can be different.)  Find all $n$ for which
    such a set of coins exists.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Can we tile a $13\times 13$ table from which we remove the
    central unit square using only $1\times 4$ or $4\times 1$ rectangles?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{In the Cartesian corrdinate plane define the
    strip \[S_n=\{(x,y):n\leq x\leq n+1\}\] for every
    integer $n$.  Assume that each strip $S_n$ is colored either red or
    blue, and let $a$ and $b$ be two distinct positive integers.  Prove
    that there exists a rectangle with side lengths $a$ and $b$ such
    that its vertices have the same color.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{A (simple and finite) graph is called [i]balanced[/i] if it has
    $n$ edges, and it is possible to assign each of the numbers
    $1,2,\ldots,n$ to an edge (one number per edge) in such a way that
    teh sum of the numbers assigned to the edges connecting to each
    vertex is the same.  Determine if every balanced graph is connected.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Find all positive integers $n$, for which the numbers in the set
    $S=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ can be colored red and blue, with the following
    condition being satisfied: the set $S\times S\times S$ contains
    exactly 2007 ordered triples $(x,y,z)$ such that (i) $x,y,z$ are of
    the same color and (ii) the integer $x+y+z$ is divisible by $n$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Every positive integer is colored in either red or blue.  Prove
    that there exists an infinite sequence $a_1<a_2<\cdots$ such that
    the
    sequence \[a_1,\frac{a_1+a_2}2,a_2,\frac{a_2+a_3}2,a_3,\frac{a_3+a_4}2,\ldots\]
    is a monochromatic integer sequence.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{A collection of $\frac{n^2+n}2$ mathematicians are arranged in a series of
    piles.  A move consists in taking one mathematician from each pile
    and forming a new pile from these.  (A pile whose last element has
    been removed is no longer a pile.)  Prove that after some number of
    moves, the piles will have sizes $1,2,\ldots, n$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given a square board of size $n\times n$, where $n$ is an
    integer greater than 1, we label some of the squares by distinct
    numbers from the set $\{1,2,\ldots,n^2\}$.  What is the largest
    number of board squares we can label in this way without creating a
    difference of $n$ or higher between any two labels on neighboring
    squares on the board?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Determine the minimum positive integer $n$ satisfying the
    following condition: If each of the vertices of an $n$-sided regular
    polygon is colored in one of the three colors (say, red, green, and
    blue), then there is a monochromatic isosceles trapezoid.  (Note
    that a parallelogram is not a trapezoid).}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{For a given prime $p$, find the greatest positive integer $n$
    with the following property: the edges of the complete graph on $n$
    vertices can be colored with $p+1$ colors so that:
   [ol][li]at least two edges have different colors;[/li]
    [li]if $A,B $ and $C$ are any three vertices and the edges $AB$ and
    $AC$ are of the same color, then $BC$ has the same color as well.[/li][/ol]}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Every integer is marked with one of 100 colors so that there is
    at least one number of each color.  If $[a,b]$ and $[c,d]$ are two
    intervals of the same length such that $a$ and $c$ have the same
    color and also $b$ and $d$ have the same color, then $a+x$ and $c+x$
    have the same color for each $x\in [0,b-a]$.  Prove that $-2001$ and
    $2001$ have different colors.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{For what values of $n$ is it possible to color every square in
    an $n\times n$ grid red, blue, yellow, green, or orange, so that for
    all $i,j,k$ between $1$ and $n$ with $i\neq j$ and $j\neq k$, the
    square in row $i$ and column$j$ is assigned a different color from
    the square in row $j$ and column $k$?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $a_1\geq a_2\geq\cdots\geq a_k$ and $b_1\geq
    b_2\geq\cdots\geq b_m$ be nonnegative integers such
    that \[\min(a_1,d)+\min(a_2,d)+\cdots+\min(a_k,d)\geq
    b_1+b_2+\cdots+b_d\] for all $d\leq m$
    and \[\min(b_1,d)+\min(b_2,d)+\cdots+\min(b_m,d)\geq a_1+a_2+\cdots
    +a_d\] for all $d\leq k$.  Prove that we can mark some of the
    squares of a $k\times m$ table so that the numbers of marked squares
    in the rows are exactly $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_k$ and in the columns are
    exactly $b_1,b_2,\ldots,b_m$.}}}[/li]
