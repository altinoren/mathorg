 Inclusion-Exclusion can be a useful method for counting
the union of a collection of prescribed sets.  Suppose we are
given a bunch of finite sets $S_1,S_2,\ldots, S_n$.  A first
approximation to the number of elements of $S_1\cup S_2\cup
\cdots\cup S_n$ might be $$|S_1\cup S_2\cup \cdots\cup S_n| =
|S_1|+ |S_2|+ \cdots+ |S_n|.$$  This of course does not work in
general: the $S_i$ might overlap.  So as a second approximation,
we might subtract off the sizes of all the pairwise intersections
$S_i\cap S_j$, $i\neq j$.  Now we are undercounting the elements
which occur in three of the sets, so we add those back, etc.

Pursuant of a systematic approach to all this, we formulate a
theorem.

[b]Theorem 1.[/b] (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion)  Let $S_1,\ldots, S_n$ be a
collection of $n$ finite sets.  Then: $\begin{equation} |S_1\cup
S_2\cup\cdots\cup S_n| = \sum_{1\leq i\leq n} |S_i| - \sum_{1\leq
i < j\leq n} |S_i \cap S_j|\nonumber  + \sum_{1\leq i< j < k\leq
n} |S_i\cap S_j\cap S_k| - \cdots + (-1)^{n-1}|S_1\cap
S_2\cap\cdots\cap S_n|. \nonumber\end{equation}$

[b]Proof 1.[/b] We need to check that each element of the union of the $S_i$ is
counted only once on the right-hand side.  Suppose, then, that $x$
is an element of the union, and let $k\geq 1$ be the number of
sets in the collection in which $x$ appears.  The first summation
will count $x$ a number of times equal to $k$; once for each set
in which $x$ appears.  The second sum will count $x$ once for
every pair of sets with $x$ appearing in both; there are
$\binom{k}{2}$ of those.  Similarly, the third summation counts
$\binom{k}{3}$, and the $j^{\mathrm {th}}$ counts $\binom{k}{j}$.  Therefore,
the total number of times $x$ is counted is \[\binom{k}{1} -
\binom{k}{2} + \binom{k}{3} - \cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\binom{k}{k} =
1-(1-1)^k = 1.\]  Each element is thus counted 1 time on the
right-hand side, and we are done.

Notice that it follows from the argument that if we sum up to the
$r^{\mathrm {th}}$ term of the Inclusion-Exclusion formula, then we will be
equal to or over the final count if $r$ is odd and equal to or
under if $r$ is even.  This follows from the fact that
\[\binom{k}{1}-\binom{k}{2}+\binom{k}{3}-\cdots+(-1)^{r-1}\binom{k}{r}
= 1 + (-1)^{r-1}\binom{k-1}{r}.\]  These facts (I think) are known
as \emph {Bonferonni's Inequalities.}

The statement of this theorem may look a bit intimidating, but it
is actually quite simple.  For example, the case $n=3$ gives \[
|R\cup S\cup T| = |R| + |S| + |T| - |R\cap S| - |R\cap T| - |S\cap
T| + |R\cap S\cap T|.\]  Putting this into practice, suppose
$R=\{a,b,c,d,e\}$, $S=\{b,c,e,f\}$, and $T=\{a,c,f,g\}$.  Then we
conclude that \[|R\cup S\cup T| = 5+4+4 - 3-2-2+1 = 7.\]

Inclusion-Exclusion is often known in the following (equivalent
but) different form:

[b]Corollary 1.[/b] Let $S_1\ldots,S_n$ be subsets of a set $X$, and let $S_i^c$
denote the complement of $S_i$ in $X$.  Then $\begin{equation} |S_1^c\cap
S_2^c\cap\cdots \cap S_n^c| = |X| - \sum_{1\leq i\leq n} |S_i| +
\sum_{1\leq i < j\leq n} |S_i \cap S_j|\nonumber  - \sum_{1\leq
i< j < k\leq n} |S_i\cap S_j\cap S_k| + \cdots + (-1)^n|S_1\cap
S_2\cap\cdots\cap S_n|. \nonumber\end{equation}$

[b]Proof 2.[/b] This follows from Inclusion-Exclusion upon observing that
\[S_1^c\cap S_2^c\cap\cdots \cap S_n^c = \left( S_1\cup S_2\cup\cdots\cup
S_n\right)^c.\]

This form has a particularly elegant version.  Fix a finite set
$X$, and for any $\mathcal C$ a finite (possibly empty) collection
of subsets of $X$, let $\bigcap \mathcal C$ be the intersection of
all elements of $\mathcal C$, or $X$ if $\mathcal C$ is empty.
Then: \[\left|\bigcap_{S\in\mathcal C}S^c\right| = \sum_{\mathcal
U\subseteq\mathcal C} (-1)^{|\mathcal U|}\left|\bigcap\mathcal
U\right|.\]

 Let us look at some examples of inclusion-exclusion in
action.

 [b]Example 1.[/b] Determine the number of primes less or
equal to 111.

 [b]Example 2.[/b][AIME 2001] Each unit square of a
3-by-3 unit-square grid is to be colored either blue or red. For
each square, either color is equally likely. What is the
probability of obtaining a grid that does not have a 2-by-2 red
square?

 [b]Example 3.[/b]  Let $n$ be a positive integer.  How
many positive integers less than or equal to $n$ are relatively
prime to $n$?

 [b]Example 4.[/b]  There are 10 seniors asking Mr. Phat
to write college recommendation letters. Mr.\ Phat writes a letter
for each one of them and then labels the 10 envelopes. If he
randomly places one letter into each labeled envelope, what is the
probability that no letter is placed in the correct envelope?

 [b]Example 5.[/b][IMO 1989] A permutation $(x_1, x_2,
\dots , x_{2n})$ of the set $\{ 1, 2, \dots , 2n\}$, where $n$ is
a positive integer, is said to have property $P$ if
\[
|x_i - x_{i+1}| = n
\]
for at least one $i \in \{ 1, 2, \dots , 2n-1\}$. Show that, for
each $n$, there are more permutations with property $P$ than
without.

 [b]Example 6.[/b] At the beginning of the 2002 season,
the 20 players of Mr. Phly's soccer team lined up in a row to take
a team picture. At the end of their undefeated season, the players
decided to take another team picture so that everyone had a
different right-hand neighbor in the new picture. In how many ways
could they have done this?

 [b]Example 7.[/b] Let $A$ and $B$ be two finite sets,
with $|A|=n$ and $|B|=m$. Determine the number $s_{n,m}$ of
surjective functions $f:A\rightarrow B$.

 [b]Example 8.[/b][Probleme des menages] How
many ways can $n$ married couples sit at a round table in such a
way that there is one man between every two women and no man is
seated next to his wife? (Rotations of the same configuration are
considered to be equivalent.)
