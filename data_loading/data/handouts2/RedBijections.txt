[h2]Bijections[/h2]

A bijection is simply another way of counting. Let's say we have two sets of objects; then we pair up objects and show that the pairing matches every object from one set with exactly one object in the other set. This is the same as counting on your fingers or even just doing arithmetic.

If we wanted to show that sets $A$ and $B$ have the same size, then we want to pair up the elements of $A$ to the elements of $B$. For $a\in A$, let $f(a)$ tell us which element in $B$ that $a$ is paired with. We want to make sure that no two elements of $A$ get sent to the same element of $B$ (also called one-to-one or injective). We also want to make sure that every element of $B$ gets paired with something in $A$ (also called onto or surjective). If our function $f$ is both surjective and injective then it is called a bijection and $A$ and $B$ must have the same size. 

Note: Often times the pairing found when solving a bijection doesn't translate into what we are used to when we think of a function $f$. For example, we may be sending arrangements of blocks to other arrangements of blocks by a transformation which is easy to explain in words, but hard to write as a function of blocks.

  [li]{{{(St. Petersburg, 1989) Tram tickets have six-digit numbers (from 000000 to 999999). A ticket is called $\textit{lucky}$ if the sum of its first three digits is equal to the sum of its last three digits. A ticket is called \textit{medium} if the sum of all its digits is 27. Let $A$ and $B$ denote the numbers of lucky tickets and medium tickets respectively. Prove that $A=B$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $F_n$ be the number of ways to tile a $1\times n$ board with $1\times 1$ squares and $1\times 2$ dominoes. Show that $F_n^2-F_{n-1}F_{n+1}=(-1)^n$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Putnam 2003) A Dyck $n$-path is a lattice path of $n$ upsteps (1,1) and$n$ downsteps $(1,-1)$ that starts at the origin $O$ and never dips below the $x$-axis. A return is a maximal sequence of contiguous downsteps that terminates on the $x$-axis. Show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the Dyck $n$-paths with no return of even length and the Dyck $(n-1)$ paths.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{The Catalan number $C_n$ counts the number of ways to properly arrange $n$ open parenthesis and $n$ closed parenthesis. Show that $C_n$ also count the number of ways to draw $n-1$ non-intersecting diagonals in a $n+2$-gon.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(1983 AIME) For $S_n=\{1,2,\dots n\}$ and each of its non-empty subsets, a unique \textit{alternating sum} is defined as follows: Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order, and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. (For example, the alternating sum for $\{1,2,4,6,9\}$ is $9-6+4-2+1=6$ and for $\{5\}$ it is simply 5.) In terms of $n$, find the sum of the alternating sums of all non-empty subsets of $S_n$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $n$ be a positive integer, let $A_n$ be the number of ways to represent $n$ as an ordered sum of 1s and 2s, and let $B_n$ be the number of ways to represent $n+2$ as an ordered sum as of one or more integers greater than 1. Prove that $A_n=B_n$ for all positive integers $n$. For example, for $n=4$, we have $4=1+1+1+1=2+1+1=1+2+1=1+1+2=2+2$ (5 ways), and $6=4+2=2+4=3+3=2+2+2=6$ (5 ways).}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Prove Cayley's formula. There are $n^{n-2}$ spanning trees of a $K_n$ with labeled vertices. (Hint: Try counting the number of sequences of $n-1$ edges which form a tree with a root, and counting the number of ways to form a tree with edges directed away from the root.)}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{The Prufer sequence is used to describe trees. The Prufer sequence for a tree is generated by removing the smallest leaf from the tree and writing down the vertex it was adjacent to. This is repeated until there are only 2 vertices left. So, the sequence has length $n-2$ and each value is between 1 and $n$. Use Prufer sequences to prove Cayley's formula.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $f(n)$ be the number of subsets of $\{1,2,\dots,n\}$ whose sum is divisible by $n$. Let $g(n)$ be the number of necklaces of length $n$ of white and black beads. If $n$ is odd, then show that $f(n)=g(n)$.}}}[/li]
