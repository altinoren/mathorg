[h2]Introduction[/h2]
You probably know that, in a triangle $ABC$:
[ul][li]The medians meet at a single point $G$, called [i]centroid[/i];[/li]
  [li]The internal angle bisectors meet at a single point $I$, called [i]incenter[/i];[/li]
  [li]Two external angle bisectors of $B$ and $C$ and the internal angle bisector of $A$ meet at a single point $I_a$, called [i]$A$-excenter[/i];[/li]
  [li]The perpendicular bisectors meet at a single point $O$, called [i]circumcenter[/i], which is also the center of the circle that contains $A$, $B$ abd $C$ (called the [i]circumcenter[/i]);[/li]
  [li]The altitudes meet at a single point $H$, called [i]orthocenter[/i].[/li][/ul]

Now prove the following theorems:
[b]Fact 1.[/b] (Euler line) The orthocenter $H$, the centroid $G$ and the circumcenter $O$ are collinear, and $HG = 2\cdot GO$.

[b]Fact 2.[/b] (Nine-point circle) The midpoints, the feet of the altitudes and the midpoints of the segments connecting the vertices to the orthocenter of a triangle lie on a circle with center in the midpoint of the segment connecting the orthocenter and the circumcenter.

[b]Fact 3.[/b] (Nine-point circle facts) In a triangle,
[ul][li]the radius of the nine-point circle is half of the circumradius.[/li]
  [li]the center of the direct homothety taking the circumcircle to the nine-point circle is the orthocenter $H$.[/li]
  [li]the center of the inverse homothety taking the circumcircle to the nine-point circle is the centroid $G$.[/li][/ul]

[b]Fact 4.[/b] (Orthocenter and the circumcircle) The reflections of the orthocenter with respect to the sides of its triangle lie on its circumcircle.

[b]Fact 5.[/b] (The ubiquitous in(ex)center property) Let $I$ be the incenter and $I_a$ be the $A$-excenter of a triangle $ABC$ and $L$ be the midpoint of the arc $BC$ from the circumcircle of $ABC$ that doesn't contain $A$. Then there is a circle with center in $L$ that passes through $B$, $C$, $I$ and $I_a$. Notice that this means that $LB = LC = LI = LI_a$ and, moreover, $L$ is the midpoint of $II_a$.

There is a number of ways of interpreting this fact:
[ol]
  [li]{{{$L$ is the circumcenter of the quadrilateral $BICI_a$;}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{You can find the incenter and $A$-excenter of a triangle by marking $L$ and drawing a circle with center in $L$ and radius $LB = LC$. The incenter is the intersection of said circle and angle bisector $AL$. This is particularly useful when you need to prove that $I$ is the incenter or $I_a$ is the $A$-excenter: you don't have to prove that it's the intersection of two bisectors.}}}[/li]
[/ol]

[b]Fact 6.[/b] (Internal, external, perpendicular bisectors) Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Then the internal and external angle bisectors of $A$ and the perpendicular bisector of $BC$ determine a triangle whose vertices lie on the circumcircle.

[b]Fact 7.[/b] (Buy two, get the third free) Let $ABC$ be a triangle. If $P$ and $Q$ are points in the plane such that $\angle PAB = \angle CAQ$ and $\angle PBC = \angle ABQ$ (directed angles!) then $\angle PCA = \angle BCQ$. Points $P$ and $Q$ are said to be isogonal conjugates with respect to triangle $ABC$.

[b]Fact 8.[/b] (Symmedians) Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Then the isogonal line of the median through $A$ passes through the intersection of the tangent lines to the circumcircle through $B$ and $C$.

[b]Fact 9.[/b] (More symmedian facts) Let $AN$ be a symmedian of triangle $ABC$, $N$ on $BC$. Then
[ol]
  [li]{{{The ratio of the distances from any point in line $AN$ to $AB$ and $AC$ is equal to $\frac{AB}{AC}$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{$\frac{BN}{NC} = \left(\frac{AB}{AC}\right)^2$.}}}[/li]
[/ol]


[h2]Some trig[/h2]
Trigonometry can be a handful in many problems (trig bashers, rejoice!). So it's good to know some identities.
[b]Fact 10.[/b] (Triangle trig) Let $ABC$ be a triangle. For simplicity, let $\alpha = \angle A$, $\beta = \angle B$, $\gamma = \angle C$, $a = BC$, $b = CA$, $c = AB$, $R$ be the circumradius, $p = \frac{a+b+c}2$ be the semiperimeter and $r$ be the inradius. Then
[ul][li]$\sin\alpha = \frac a{2R}$[/li]
  [li]the distance from the circumcenter to side $BC$ is $R\cos\alpha = \frac a2\cot\alpha$[/li]
  [li]$r = 4R\sin\frac\alpha2\sin\frac\beta2\sin\frac\gamma2$[/li]
  [li]$p-a = 4R\cos\frac\alpha2\sin\frac\beta2\sin\frac\gamma2$[/li]
  [li]$p = 4R\cos\frac\alpha2\cos\frac\beta2\cos\frac\gamma2$[/li][/ul]


This is not really a trigonometric identity, but it has the spirit of one.
[b]Fact 11.[/b] (Stewart's theorem) Let $ABC$ be a triangle and $P$ be a point on side $BC$. Then
$$AB^2\cdot CP + AC^2\cdot BP = BC\cdot (AP^2 + BP\cdot CP)$$
