We will consider the notion of [i]arithmetic function[/i].

[b]Definition 1.[/b] An [i]arithmetic function[/i] is a function $f:\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb C$.  In other words, it takes as input any positive integer, and has as output any complex number.  We say that an arithmetic function $f(n)$ is [i]multiplicative[/i] if  [ol][li]$f(1)=1$;[/li]
    [li]Whenever $(m,n)=1$, $f(mn)=f(m)f(n)$.[/li][/ol]  If the second condition holds without the assumption of relative primality, we say that $f(n)$ is [i]strictly multiplicative[/i].

We have already seen a good example of a strictly multiplicative arithmetic function, namely the Legendre symbol with respect to a fixed prime $p$.  There are of course many simpler examples.  A few are listed below:

[ul][li]The function $I(n)=n$ which takes every positive integer to itself.[/li]
  [li]The function $u(n) = 1$, which takes every positive integer to 1.[/li]
  [li]More generally, for a complex number $s$, the function $e_s(n) = n^s$, which raises $n$ to the $s$th power, so that $I = e_1$ and $u= e_0$.[/li]
  [li]The function $|n|_p = \frac 1{p^r}$, where $p^r || n$.  This is the so-called $p$-adic norm, and arises naturally in the discussion of $p$-adic numbers.[/li]
  [li]The function $\iota(n)$, defined to be 1 if $n=1$ and 0 otherwise.  You might think of this as $e_{-\infty}$.[/li][/ul]

If we weaken our demands to only multiplicative functions, then our examples become much more interesting:

[ul][li]The function $\tau(n)$ which counts the number of divisors of $n$.[/li]
  [li]The totient function $\varphi(n)$, which counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$.[/li]
  [li]The function $\sigma(n)$ which denotes the sum of all divisors of $n$.[/li][/ul]

We will prove that these are multiplicative all at once, even though we could easily do so for each function individually.  Our course of action will be to use the following notion, variants of which show up all across mathematics:

[b]Definition 2.[/b] Suppose $f$ and $g$ are two arithmetic functions.  We define their [i]convolution[/i] $f*g$ as the following: \[(f*g)(n) = \sum_{d | n} f(d)g(\frac nd).\]

This definition may seem to come out of nowhere; however it places the above discussion into a new context, as explored in the exercises.

We will want a few simple properties:

[b]Theorem 1.[/b] The following properties are enjoyed by convolution:
[ol]
  [li]If $f,g$ are arithmetic functions, then $f*g = g*f$.[/li]
  [li]If $f,g,h$ are arithmetic functions, then $(f*g)*h = f*(g*h)$.[/li]
  [li]If $f$ is an arithmetic function, then $f*\iota = f$.[/li]
  [li]If $f$ and $g$ are multiplicative, then so is $f*g$ (this is NOT true in the strictly multiplicative case!)[/li]
[/ol]

In other words, convolution gives the set of arithmetic functions a kind of addition with identity (what is known as a [i]monoid law[/i]), and the set of multiplicative functions is closed under this new operation.

We introduce a new multiplicative function:

[b]Definition 3.[/b] The Mobius function $\mu$ is defined as follows:\[\mu(n) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \textrm{if }n=1  (-1)^k & \textrm{if }n\textrm{ is squarefree and the product of }k\textrm{ distinct primes}  0 & \textrm{otherwise.}\end{array}\right.\]

We see immediately that $\mu(n)$ is a multiplicative function.  In fact, we have the following neat result:

[b]Theorem 2.[/b] (M\"obius Inversion Formula) Let $f(n)$ be an arithmetic function, and let $F(n)$ be defined like so:
\[F(n) = \sum_{d | n} f(d).\]  Then we may recover $f(n)$ from $F(n)$ in the following way: \[f(n) = (F*\mu)(n) = \sum_{d|n} F(d)\mu(\frac nd).\]

In the exercises we explore some things we may use this for.
