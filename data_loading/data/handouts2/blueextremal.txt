These problems focus on the method of taking extremal values,
extremal elements, etc.  Arguments of this sort take the form
"let $x$ be the least such that blah" or "let $y$ be the
largest so that foo."  This is not a concept so much as an
approach to many types of problems, and so we practice it.

  [li]{{{Let $f(x)$ be a polynomial in $\mathbb{R}[x]$ of degree $n$ such
  that $f(x)\geq 0$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$.  Show that $f(x)+f'(x)+\cdots
  +f^{(n)}(x)\geq0$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Prove that every sequence of $n^2+1$ real numbers must
  have an $(n+1)$-element monotone subsequence. ("Monotone" here
  does not mean [i]strictly[/i] monotone!)}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Putnam 93/A4) Let $x_1,x_2,\ldots, x_{19}$ be positive
  integers each of which is less than or equal to 93. Let
  $y_1,y_2,\ldots, y_{93}$ be positive integers each of which is
  less than or equal to 19.  Prove that there exists a (nonempty)
  sum of some $x_i$'s equal to a sum of some $y_j$'s.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(IMO '68) Prove that in every tetrahedron there is a vertex
  such that the three edges meeting there have lengths which are the
  sides of a triangle.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Russian) Several pieces are placed on a chessboard. At
  each move one of them goes to one of the adjacent squares. After
  several moves it turns out that each piece has visited every
  square on the board, and finally returned back to its initial
  square.   Prove that there was a move after which none of the
  pieces occupied its initial position.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Prove that in each closed polygonal line there exists a
  side $AB$ and a vertex $C$ ($C\neq A,B$), such that the foot of
  the perpendicular from $C$ to the line $AB$ lies on the
  line-segment $AB$, and not on its extension.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Russian, 1977) The Seven Dwarfs sit around a circular
  table waiting for Snow White.  Each of them has a big cup, and
  some of the cups contain milk. The first dwarf pours out all his
  milk into the other six cups, dividing it into six equal portions.
  The dwarf to his right follows suit.  And so they continue, until
  the seventh dwarf pours out all his milk into the other six cups
  (dividing it into six equal portions).  Then it turns out that
  each of the dwarfs has exactly as much milk as when they started.
  Find the amount of milk originally contained in each cup if the
  total amount was 3 liters.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Hungary, 1990) We wander the coordinate plane according
  to the following rules.  From a given point $P(x,y)$ we are
  allowed to move to one of the four points
  $(x,y+2x),(x,y-2x),(x-2y,y),(x+2y,y)$. There is only one
  restriction:  if we have moved from $P$ to $Q$ then we cannot go
  back to $P$ immediately on the next move.  Prove that, starting
  from the point $(1,\sqrt2)$, we cannot return to it, ever.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given any $n+2$ distinct numbers from the first $3n$

  [li]{{{Twenty-three people, each with integral weight, decide to
  play football, separating into two teams of eleven people, plus a
  referee. To keep things fair, the teams chosen must have equal

  chosen to be the referee, this can always be done. Prove that the
  23 people must all have the same weight.}}}[/li]

    [li]Lines $\ell_1,$ $\ell_2,$ $\cdots,$ $\ell_k$ are in
  general position in the plane (no two are parallel and no three

  $\ell_k$ all the labels appear exactly once?[/li][/ol]}}}[/li]
