[b]Abstract.[/b] One important skill in Math is finding patterns. This also applies to Geometry: there are some really cool diagrams that have tons of nice properties. I'll talk about some of my favorites.

[h2]The ubiquitous in(ex)center lemma[/h2]
There is another characterization of the incenter and the excenter of a triangle that can be useful in at least two situations:
[ul][li]you need to prove that some point is the incenter or excenter of a triangle;[/li]
  [li]you need some isosceles triangles or collinear points.[/li][/ul]

[b]Fact 1.[/b] (The ubiquitous in(ex)center property) Let $I$ be the incenter and $I_a$ be the $A$-excenter of a triangle $ABC$ and $L$ be the midpoint of the arc $BC$ from the circumcircle of $ABC$ that doesn't contain $A$. Then there is a circle with center in $L$ that passes through $B$, $C$, $I$ and $I_a$. Notice that this means that $LB = LC = LI = LI_a$ and, moreover, $L$ is the midpoint of $II_a$.

There are a number of ways of interpreting this fact:
[ol]
  [li]$L$ is the circumcenter of the quadrilateral $BICI_a$;[/li]
  [li]You can find the incenter and $A$-excenter of a triangle by marking $L$ and drawing a circle with center in $L$ and radius $LB = LC$. The incenter is the intersection of said circle and angle bisector $AL$. This is particularly useful when you need to prove that $I$ is the incenter or $I_a$ is the $A$-excenter: you don't have to prove that it's the intersection of two bisectors.[/li]
[/ol]

[h2]Two circles and a tangent line[/h2]
[b]Fact 2.[/b] (Two circles and a tangent line) Let $\Omega$ and $\omega$ be two circles internally tangent at $T$. Chord $AB$ from $\Omega$ touches $\omega$ at $P$. Line $PT$ meet $\Omega$ at $L\neq T$.

[ol]
  [li]Point $L$ is the midpoint of the arc $AB$ that does not contain $T$.[/li]
  [li]The inversion with center $L$ and radius $LA$ fixes the diagram (it actually takes $AB$ to $\Omega$ and vice-versa).[/li]
  [li]$LP\cdot LT = LA^2$.[/li]
  [li]$L$ has the same power with respect to all circles $\omega$ that are tangent to both chord $AB$ and $\Omega$. Rephrasing: the radical axes of all pairs of such circles $\omega$ pass through $L$.[/li]
[/ol]

[h2]Symmedians[/h2]
The [i]symmedians[/i] of a triangle $ABC$ are the reflections of the medians with respect to the corresponding internal bisectors. They have some incredible properties.

[b]Fact 3.[/b] (Symmedian facts) Symmedians have [i]tons[/i] of properties. Here are only some of them.
[ol]
  [li][i](Finding the symmedian)[/i] Let $\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $ABC$; the tangent lines at $B$ and $C$ meet at $D$; then $AD$ is the symmedian.  
  [Image missing][/li]
  [li][i](Symmedian ratios)[/i] Let $P$ be any point in the $A$-symmedian. Then the ratio between the distances from $P$ to $AB$ and $AC$ is $\frac{AB}{AC}$. Also, the $A$-symmedian divides side $BC$ in the ratio $\frac{AB^2}{AC^2}$.[/li]
  [li][i](A similarity)[/i] Let the circumcircle of $BCD$ meet line $AD$ again at $K$. Then $ABK$ and $CAK$ are (spirally) similar.[/li]
  [li][i](Symmedians in cyclic quads)[/i] Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. Then $AB\cdot CD = AD\cdot BC$ iff $AC$ is a symmedian of both $ABD$ and $BCD$ and $BD$ is a symmedian of both $ABC$ and $ADC$.[/li]
  [li][i](Symmedian and bisectors)[/i] Let line $AD$ meet $BC$ at $T$ and the circumcircle at $L\neq A$ and let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Then lines $BC$ and $MD$ are the internal and external bisectors of $\angle LMA$.[/li]
[/ol]

[h2]Complete quadrilaterals[/h2]
A [i]complete[/i] quadrilateral is the union of four non-parallel lines. They determine $\binom42 = 6$ points, which are the vertices of this complete quadrilateral (weird, huh?). Nevertheless, this configuration is pretty cool.

[b]Fact 4.[/b] (Complete quadrilateral facts) Here's what you get if you complete the quadrilateral:

[Image missing]

Now let's see what this complex diagram has to offer:
[ol]
  [li][i](Miquel's theorem)[/i] The circumcircles of the $\binom43 = 4$ triangles determined by the four lines have a common point, named [i]Miquel point[/i] of the complete quadrilateral.[/li]
  [li][i](Spiral similarity and Miquel's theorem)[/i] The Miquel point is the center of several spiral similarities that take two of the six points to another two of the six points. Eg (refer to the diagram above), $EC\to AF$, $EA\to CF$, $AB\to DC$, $AD\to BC$.[/li]
  [li][i](Midpoints in a Gauss line)[/i] The six points of a complete quadrilateral determine three diagonals (segments that are not contained in any of the four original lines). The midpoints of these lines are collinear (the line passing through these points is called the [i]Gauss line[/i] of the complete quadrilateral.[/li]
  [li][i](More points in a circle, not pictured)[/i] The circumcircles of the four triangles determined by the four lines and the Miquel point lie on a circle.[/li]
  [li][i](Projecting the Miquel point)[/i] The orthogonal projections of the Miquel point onto the four lines are collinear. Moreover, the line passing through the four projections is perpendicular to the Gauss line.[/li]
[/ol]

If, in addition, you have a cyclic quad, some additional magic happens!

[b]Fact 5.[/b] (Complete cyclic quad facts) Here's what you get if you complete a cyclic quad:

[Image missing]

Refer to the previous diagram, where $ABCD$ is cyclic. Let $E$ and $F$ be the intersection points of the opposite sides of $ABCD$.
[ol]
  [li][i](Cool power of a point)[/i] The sum of the powers of $E$ and $F$ with respect to the circumcircle of $ABCD$ is $EF^2$.[/li]
  [li][i](Miquel point in a cyclic quad)[/i] The Miquel point of the complete quadrilateral gerenated by $ABCD$ lies on $EF$. In fact, the Miquel point lies on $EF$ iff the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is cyclic.[/li]
  [li][i](Perpendicular lines)[/i] Let $O$ be the circumcircle of $ABCD$. Then $OM$ is perpendicular to $EF$.[/li]
  [li][i](More collinear points)[/i] The point of intersection of the diagonals $AC$ and $BD$ meet at a point on line $OM$.[/li]
  [li][i](Bisectors and in(ex)centers)[/i] $OM$ bisects $\angle AMC$ and $\angle BMD$. Plus, line $OM$ meets the circumcircle of $ABCD$ at the incenter and the $M$-excenter of both triangles $AMC$ and $BMD$ (yep, the incenter and the $M$-excenter coincide in both triangles).[/li]
[/ol]
