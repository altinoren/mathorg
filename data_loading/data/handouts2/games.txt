  [li]{{{(Colombia 1997) We play the following game with a triangle of $n(n+1)/2$ pennies (so that there are $n$ pennies to a side).  Initially, all hte pennies are turned heads up.  On each turn, we may turn over three pennies at a time which are mutually adjacent; the goal is to make all the pennies tails up.  For which values of $n$ can this be achieved?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Taiwan 1995) Consider the operation which transforms te $8$-term sequence $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_8$ into the new sequence \[ |x_1-x_2|,|x_2-x_3|,\ldots,|x_7-x_8|,|x_8-x_1|.\]  Find all $8$-terms initial sequences that have the property that after finitely many applications of this operation, one is left with a sequence of equal terms.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Russia 1995) Two positive integers are written on the board.  The following operation is repeated: if $a<b$ are the numbers on the board, then $a$ is erased and $ab/(b-a)$ is written in its place.  At some point the numbers on the board are equal.  Prove that they are again positive integers.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(USAMO 1995/2) A calculator is broken so that the only keys that still work are the $\sin$, $\cos$, $\tan$, $\sin^{-1}$, $\cos^{-1}$, and $\tan^{-1}$ keys.  The display initially shows $0$.  Given any positive rational number $q$, show that pressing some finite sequence of buttons will yield $q$.  Assume that the calculator does real number calculations with infinite precision.  All functions are in terms of radians.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Russia 2001) Peter and Alex play a game starting with an ordered pair of integers $(a,b)$.  On each turn, the current player increases or decreases either $a$ or $b$: Peter by $1$, and Alex by $1$ or $3$.  Alex wins if at some point the roots of $x^2+ax+b$ are integers.  Is it true that given any initial values $a$ and $b$, Alex can guarantee that he wins?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Ireland 1995) Consider the following one-person game played on the $x$-axis.  For each integer $k$, let $X_k$ be the point $(k,0)$.  During the game, disks are piled at some of the points $X_k$.  To perform a move in the game, the player chooses a point $X_j$ at which at least two disks are piled and moves one disk to point $X_{j-1}$ and another to point $X_{j+1}$.  To begin the game, $2n+1$ disks are placed at $X_0$.  The player then proceeds to perform moves for as long as possible.  Prove that after $n(n+1)(2n+1)/6$ moves, no further moves are possible and that at this stage, one disk remains at each of the points $X_{-n},\ldots,X_n$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(IMO 1996/1) We are given a positive integer $r$ and a rectangular board $ABCD$ with dimensions $|AB|=20$, $|BC|=12$.  The recatngle is divided into a $20\times 12$ grid of unit squares.  The following moves are permitted on the board: one can move from one square to another only if the distance between the centers of the two squares is $\sqrt{r}$.  The task is to find a sequence of moves leading from the square with $A$ as a vertex to the square with $B$ as a vertex.  [ol][li]Show that the task cannot be done if $r$ is divisible by 2 or 3.[/li]
    [li]Prove that the task is possible if $r=73.$[/li]
    [li]Can the task be done when $r=97$?[/li]}}}[/li]

  [li]Starting at $(1,1)$, a stone is moved in the coordinate plane according to the following rules: [ol][/li]
    [li]From any point $(a,b)$ the stone can be moved to $(2a,b)$ or $a,2b)$.[/li]
    [li]From any point $(a,b)$, the stone can be moved to $(a-b,b)$ if $a>b$ or to $(a,b-a)$ if $b>a$.[/li][/ol] For which positive integers $(x,y)$ can the stone be moved to $(x,y)$?
  [li]{{{(Ireland 1996) On a $5\times 9$ rectangular chessboard, the following game is played.  Initially, $n$ stones are placed on some of the squares, no square containing more than one stone.  A turn consists in moving all of the stones at once according to the following rules:  [ol][li]each stone may be moved one square up, down, left or right;[/li]
    [li]if a stone moves up or down on one turn, it must move left or right on the next, and vice versa;[/li]
    [li]no square may ever contain more than one stone.[/li][/ol]  The game stops if it becomes impossible to complete another turn.  Find the number $N$ so that if $n\leq N$ there are configurations for which the ame can go on forever, but for $n>N$ the game always eventually stops.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(USAMO 1998/4) A computer screen shows a $98\times 98$ chessboard, colored in the usual way.  One can select with a mouse any rectangle with sides on the lines of the chessboard and click the mouse button; as a result, the colors in the selected rectangle switch (black becomes white, white becomes black).  Find, with proof, the minimum number of mouse clicks needed to make the chessboard all one color.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Belarus 2001) Let $n$ be a positive integer.  Each square of a $(2n-1)\times(2n-1)$ square board contains an arrow pointing up, down, left or right.  A bettle sits in one of the cells.  Each year it creeps from one square in the direction of the arrow in that square, either reaching another square or leaving the board.  Each time the beetle moves, the arrow in the square it leaves turns $\pi/2$ clockwise.  Prove that the beetle leaves the board in at most $2^{3n-1}(n-1)!-4$ years after it first moves.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Israel 1995) Tarzan and Jane play a game on an infinite board that consists of $1\times 1$ squares.  Tarzan chooses a square and marks it with an $O$.  Then Jane picks another square and marks it with an $X$.  They play until one of the players marks a whole row or column of five consecutive squares, and this player wins the game.  Show that Jane can prevent Tarzan from winning.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(USAMO 2003/6) At the vertices of a regular hexagon are written six nonnegative integers whose sum is 2003.  Bert is allowed to make moves of the following form: he may pick a vertex and replace the number written there by the absolute value of the difference between the numbers written at the two neighboring vertices.  Prove that Bert can make a sequence of moves, after which the number 0 appears at all six vertices.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(USAMO 1999/5) The Y2K Game is played on a $1\times 2000$ grid as follows.  Two players in turn write either an $S$ or an $O$ in an empty square.  The first player who produces three consecutive boxes that spell $SOS$ wins.  If all boxes are filled without producing $SOS$ then the game is a draw.  PRove that the second player has a winning strategy.}}}[/li]
