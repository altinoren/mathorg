The intention today is to tackle two hard questions from elementary number theory: the existence of a primitive root mod $m$, and the existence of a square root of a given residue class mod $p$.  Both were investigated at length by Gauss.

Recall that a primitive root is a residue class $\bmod m$ of order $\varphi(m)$.  Such need not exist (and indeed does not in general); however given existence we get extra structure in mod $m$ arithmetic.

[b]Theorem 1.[/b] Suppose that $\omega$ is a primitive root $\bmod m$.  Then the sequence \[\omega,\omega^2,\ldots,\omega^{\varphi(m)}\] runs through all relatively prime residue classes $\bmod m$, each exactly once.

In other words, multiplication of relatively prime residues $\bmod m$ becomes addition $\bmod\varphi(m)$.  This would be especially nice in the $\bmod p$ case, where every nonzero residue class is relatively prime, and we will in fact show that in this case we always have a primitive root.

We need a technical result:

[b]Theorem 2.[/b] Let $m$ be a nonzero integer.  Then there is a residue class $\omega \bmod m$ whose order is a multiple of all other orders (though not necessarily equal to $\varphi(m)$).

Using this, we can prove existence in a key case:

[b]Theorem 3.[/b] Let $p$ be a prime.  Then there exists a primitive root $\bmod p$.

We get a complete answer to our original question:

[b]Theorem 4.[/b] Let $m$ be a nonzero integer.  Then there is a primitive root $\bmod m$ if and only if $m=1,2,4,p^k,2p^k$, where $p$ is an odd prime and $k>0$ is an integer.  Additionally, if $\omega$ is a primitive root mod $p^2$ (respectively $2p^2$), then $\omega$ is a primitive root mod $p^k$ (respectively $2p^k$) for all $k>0$.

So ends the discussion of primitive roots.  We will use this new information to talk about the existence of square roots, or in other words the question of [i]quadratic residues[/i].

[b]Definition 1.[/b] Let $p$ be an odd prime.  A [i]quadratic residue[/i] $\bmod p$ is a nonzero residue class $a$ such that there exists a solution to $x^2=a\bmod p$.  If there is no such solution we say that $a$ is a [i]quadratic nonresidue[/i].  We write the [i]Legendre symbol[/i] like so, pronounced "$a$ on $p$:"
\[\left(\frac ap\right) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \textrm{if }a\textrm{ is a quadratic residue}  -1 & \textrm{if }a\textrm{ is a quadratic nonresidue}  0 & \textrm{if }a=0\end{array}\right.\]

The Legendre symbol encapsulates the information of whether a given residue class is a quadratic residue.  Note that from yesterday's handout we know that for $p$ an odd prime, \[\left(\frac {-1}p\right) = (-1)^{\frac {p-1}2}.\]

The Legendre symbol has the nice property of being [i]multiplicative[/i]:

[b]Theorem 5.[/b] Let $p$ be an odd prime, and let $a$ be an integer.  Then \[\left(\frac ap\right)\equiv a^{\frac {p-1}2}\bmod p.\]  In particular, the Legendre symbol is multiplicative; in other words, if $b$ is another integer then \[\left(\frac ap\right)\left(\frac bp\right) = \left(\frac{ab}p\right).\]

With a bit of careful counting, the preceding theorem can be used to compute another class of Legendre symbols:
\[\left(\frac 2p\right) = (-1)^{\frac{p^2-1}8}.\]

With more work, we may prove Quadratic Reciprocity, a surprising result due to Gauss.

[b]Theorem 6.[/b] (Quadratic Reciprocity)  Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct odd primes.  Then:
\[ \left(\frac pq\right)\left(\frac qp\right) = (-1)^{\left(\frac{p-1}2\right)\left(\frac{q-1}2\right)}.\]

Multiplicativity and the three Legendre formulas comprise an effective algorithm for computing Legendre symbols in general, and so determining whether a given residue class is a square mod $p$.
