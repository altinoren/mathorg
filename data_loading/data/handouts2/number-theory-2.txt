Today we set up modular arithmetic formally (without this exercise, it may be difficult to tell intuition from mathematical fact).  To begin, we make a simple definition.

[b]Definition 1.[/b] Let $a,b,m\in\mathbb Z$ with $m\neq 0$.  We say that [i]$a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$[/i] if $m | b-a$.  We denote this relation in symbols like so:
\[a\equiv b\bmod m.\]

The first thing to notice is that this relation has much in common with the ordinary equality relation.  In particular, it is an example of what we call an [i]equivalence relation.[/i]

[b]Definition 2.[/b] A relation $\sim$ on a set $S$ is called an [i]equivalence relation[/i] if the three following axioms are satisfied:

[ol]
  [li]Reflexivity.  For any $a\in S$, $a\sim a$.[/li]
  [li]Symmetry. For any $a,b\in S$, if $a\sim b$ then $b\sim a$.[/li]
  [li]Transitivity.  For any $a,b,c\in S$, if $a\sim b$ and $b\sim c$ then $a\sim c$.[/li]
[/ol]


Exercise: Show that an equivalence relation $\sim$ on a set $S$ partitions the set completely (into disjoint subsets whose union is all of $S$ itself).

[b]Theorem 1.[/b] Congruence mod $m$ is an equivalence relation on $\mathbb Z$, partitioning the integers into [i]residue classes[/i], corresponding to the $m$ distinct remainders upon division by $m$.

What this means is that with practice we may learn (as you probably have already) to use modular congruence algebraically as a stand-in for algebraic equality in a world of only $m$ "numbers."  Algebraic operations also go through, to an extent:


[b]Theorem 2.[/b] Let $a,b,c,m\in\mathbb Z$ with $m\neq 0$.  Then:

[ol]
  
  [li](Addition and Multiplication) If $a\equiv b\bmod m$ and $c\equiv d\bmod m$ then $a+c\equiv b+d\bmod m$ and $ac\equiv bd\bmod m$.[/li]
  [li](Exponents) If $a\equiv b\bmod m$ and $n$ is a positive integer, then $a^n\equiv b^n\bmod m$.[/li]
  [li](Polynomials) If $a\equiv b\bmod m$ and $f(x)$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, then $f(a)\equiv f(b)\bmod m$.[/li]
  [li](Cancellation) If $ca\equiv cb\bmod m$, then \[a\equiv b\bmod \frac m{(c,m)}.\]  In particular, if $(c,m)=1$, then $a\equiv b\bmod m$.[/li]
  [li](Multiplicative inverses) The residue class $a$ has a multiplicative inverse mod $m$ (that is, there exists a $b$ with $ab\equiv 1\bmod m$) if and only if $(a,m)=1$.[/li]
[/ol]

A simple problem from algebra is systems of linear equations; modular arithmetic has its own analogue, the Chinese Remainder Theorem.

[b]Theorem 3.[/b] (Chinese Remainder Theorem) Let $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n,m_1,m_2\ldots,m_n\in\mathbb Z$, with the $m_i$ nonzero and pairwise relatively prime.  Then the system of $n$ congruences \[x\equiv a_i\bmod m_i, i=1,2,\ldots,n\] has a solution $x=N$, unique modulo $m_1m_2\cdots m_n$, and there is an effective argument for computing it.

Notice that such a system "degenerates" when two or more of the $m_i$ have a common factor.
