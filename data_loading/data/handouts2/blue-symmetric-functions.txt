[h2]Definition[/h2]

A [i]symmetric function[/i], or [i]symmetric polynomial[/i], is a polynomial $f(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n)$ which is symmetric in its variables. That is, for any permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, $$f(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=f(x_{\sigma(1)},\ldots,x_{\sigma(n)}).$$  For instance, the polynomial $f(x,y,z)=3xyz+x^2+y^2+z^2$ is symmetric, but the polynomial $g(x,y,z)=x^2y+y^2z+z^2x$ is not.

[h2]Bases for symmetric functions[/h2]

There are at least four natural "bases" that generate all symmetric functions: 
[ul][li]Monomial[/li]
  [li]Elementary[/li]
  [li]Power Sum[/li]
  [li]Homogeneous[/li][/ul]
and it is often useful to write a symmetric polynomial in terms of one of these four types.  Let's explore each of these to see where they arise.

[h3]Monomial symmetric functions[/h3]

In all of what follows, let $\lambda=(\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\ldots,\lambda_k)$  be a sequence of integers written in nonincreasing order.  This can be thought of as a [i]partition[/i] of size $N=\lambda_1+\cdots+\lambda_k$, and we write $|\lambda|=N$.  Let $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ be some number of variables with $n\ge k$.

[b]Definition 1.[/b] The [b]monomial symmetric function[/b] $m_\lambda$ in $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ is the smallest symmetric sum of monomials containing $x_1^{\lambda_1}x_2^{\lambda_2}\cdots x_k^{\lambda_k}$ as a term.

[b]Example 1.[/b] The symmetric function $m_{(3,1,1)}$ in the variables $a,b,c,d$ is $$a^3bc+a^3bd+a^3cd+b^3ac+b^3ad+b^3cd+c^3ab+c^3ad+c^3bd+d^3ab+d^3ac+d^3bc.$$
This is also commonly written $$\sum_{S_{\{a,b,c,d\}}}a^3bc$$ or simply $\sum_{\text{sym}} a^3bc$ or $\sum a^3bc$ when the variables are understood.

Monomial symmetric functions are useful because of the following fact:
"[i]{{{Every symmetric function can be written uniquely as a linear combination of monomial symmetric functions.}}}[/i]"  (Prove this!)

Because of this property, we say that the monomial symmetric functions form a [i]basis[/i] for the space of all symmetric functions.  

[h3]Elementary symmetric functions[/h3]

The second important basis is the [i]elementary symmetric functions[/i].

[b]Definition 2.[/b] The symmetric function $e_k$ in the variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ is the monomial symmetric function $\sum x_1x_2\ldots x_k$.  These functions, along with any product $$e_\lambda=e_{\lambda_1}e_{\lambda_2}\cdots e_{\lambda_n}$$ of these, are called the [b]elementary symmetric functions[/b].

You may recognize $e_k$ as the $k$th coefficient of the polynomial having roots $x_1,\ldots,x_n$.

[b]Example 2.[/b] In the variables $a,b,c,d$, $$e_{(3,1,1)}=e_3e_1e_1=(abc+abd+acd+bcd)(a+b+c+d)^2.$$

It is not as obvious, but still true, that 
"[i]{{{Every symmetric function can be written uniquely as a linear combination of elementary symmetric functions.}}}[/i]"  (Prove this too!)

[h3]Power sum symmetric functions[/h3]

Another very important basis is the [i]power sum[/i] symmetric functions.

[b]Definition 3.[/b] The symmetric function $p_r$ in the variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ is the sum $x_1^r+x_2^r+\cdots+x_n^r$.  These functions, along with any product $$p_\lambda=p_{\lambda_1}p_{\lambda_2}\cdots p_{\lambda_n}$$ of these, are called the [b]power sum symmetric functions[/b].

[b]Example 3.[/b] In the variables $a,b,c,d$, $$p_{(3,3,2)}=(a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3)^2(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2).$$

Again, in this case,
"[i]{{{Every symmetric function can be written uniquely as a linear combination of power sum symmetric functions.}}}[/i]" (Prove this!)

[h3]Homogeneous symmetric functions[/h3]

Finally, we come to the [i]complete homogeneous symmetric functions[/i].  

[b]Definition 4.[/b] The symmetric function $h_d$ in the variables $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ is the sum of all monomials of degree $d$ in these variables.  These functions, along with any product $$h_\lambda=h_{\lambda_1}h_{\lambda_2}\cdots h_{\lambda_n}$$ of these, are called the [b](complete) homogeneous symmetric functions[/b].

[b]Example 4.[/b] In the variables $a,b,c,d$, $$h_{(2,1,1)}=h_2h_1^2=(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd)(a+b+c+d)^2.$$

As you might have guessed by now:
"[i]{{{Every symmetric function can be written uniquely as a linear combination of homogeneous symmetric functions.}}}[/i]" (Prove it!)

[h2]Transitioning between the bases[/h2]

We now have defined the four most useful types of symmetric functions: $m_\lambda$, $e_\lambda$, $p_\lambda$, and $h_\lambda$, and we know we can write any given symmetric function in terms of any of these four bases.  So how do we write them in terms of each other?

[i]Newton's Identities[/i] give us a way of writing the $p$'s in terms of the $e$'s.  They arise from the simple fact that if $p(x)=(x-a_1)(x-a_2)\cdots (x-a_n)$ is the polynomial with roots $a_1,\ldots,a_n$, then
 \begin{eqnarray*}
p(x) &=& x^n-\left(\sum_{\text{sym}} a_1 \right)x^{n-1}+\left(\sum_{\text{sym}} a_1a_2\right)x^{n-2}-\cdots+(-1)^n (a_1\cdot\cdots\cdot a_n) 
    &=& x^n-e_1x^{n-1}+e_2x^{n-2}-\cdots+(-1)^ne_n
\end{eqnarray*} where each $e_k$ is the elementary symmetric function in the roots $a_i$.  Plugging in $x=a_1,\ldots,x=a_n$ into this equation and summing the results, we find

$$\sum a_i^n -e_1 \sum a_i^{n-1}+\cdots+n\cdot(-1)^ne_n=0$$ and so $$p_n=e_1p_{n-1}-e_2p_{n-2}+\cdots+(-1)^{n-1}e_np_0.$$  These equations are called Newton's identities, and they give us a recursive way to compute each $p_i$ in terms of the $e_i$, or vice versa.

Given the first $n$ of these equations, we can solve for $p_1,\ldots,p_n$ explicitly, and obtain the following formula using matrices.

[b]Exercise 1.[/b] {{{(If you know a bit of linear algebra.)
  Prove that 
$$p_n=\det\left(\begin{array}{cccccc} 
  e_1        & 1       & 0       & 0        &\cdots & 0 
  2e_2       & e_1     & 1       & 0        & \cdots & 0 
  3e_3       & e_2     & e_1     &  1       & \cdots & 0 
  \vdots    & \vdots & \vdots  & \vdots &  \ddots & \vdots 
(n-1)e_{n-1} & e_{n-2} & e_{n-3} &  e_{n-4}  & \ddots & 1  
  ne_n       & e_{n-1} & e_{n-2} &  e_{n-3}   & \cdots & e_1 
\end{array}\right)$$}}}

We can now write the $p$'s in terms of the $e$'s.  To write the other bases in terms of each other, see problems 12-14 below.
