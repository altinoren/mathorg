  [li]{{{Find the centroid of $\triangle ABC$ in terms of arbitrary vector
    representations of its vertices.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Using vectors, show that the circumcenter, centroid, center of
    the nine-point circle and the orthocenter are
    collinear and that the proportions of the lengths of segments
    connecting consecutive points along the resulting Euler line are $2:1:3$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Find the volume of tetrahedron $ABCD$ in terms of arbitrary
    vector represenations of its vertices.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $ABCA'B'C'$ be a triangular prism (not necessarily right)
    with base $ABC$ and parallel edges $AA'$, $BB'$, and $CC'$.  Let $P$
    be the intersection of the planes $(ABC')$, $(AB'C)$, $(A'BC)$, and
    let $P'$ be the intersection of the planes $(AB'C')$, $(A'BC')$, and
    $(A'B'C)$.  Show that $PP'$ is parallel to $AA'$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Consider three linearly independent vectors $\vec a$, $\vec b$
    and  $\vec c$ in
    space, having the same origin.  Prove that the plane determined by
    their endpoints is perpendicular to the vector $\vec a\times \vec
    b+\vec b\times
    \vec c+\vec c\times \vec a$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Some students take a test consisting of $n$ problems.  After it
    is over, the judges assign each problem a positive integral number
    of points, and give each student a score equal to the sum of the
    points for each problem that the student solved.  (No partial
    credit!)  It would have been possible for the judges to assign point
    values so that the students' scores finish in any possible order
    (not counting ties).  What is the maximum number of students for
    which this would be able to happen?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given two triangles $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle A'B'C'$ with
    distinct vertices and the same centroid,
    prove that a triangle can be formed from the three segments $\overline{AA'}$,
    $\overline{BB'}$ and $\overline{CC'}$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Prove that the four lines through each of the centroids of
    the four faces of a tetrahedron and perpendicular to their
    respective faces are concurrent if and only if the four altitudes of the
    tetrahedron are concurrent.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $S$ be a set of 26 positive integers, none of whose prime
    factors are bigger than 100.  Show that there exists a nonempty
    subset $A\subset S$ such that the product of the elements of $A$ is
    a perfect square.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Given three vectors $\vec a$, $\vec b$, and $\vec c$,
    define \[\vec u=(\vec b\cdot
    \vec c)\vec a-(\vec c\cdot \vec a)\vec b, \vec v=(\vec a\cdot
    \vec c)\vec b-(\vec a\cdot \vec b)\vec c, \vec w=(\vec b\cdot
    \vec a)\vec c-(\vec b\cdot \vec c)\vec a,.\]  Prove that if $\vec
    a$, $\vec b$ and $\vec c$ form a triangle,
    then $\vec u$, $\vec v$ and $\vec w$ also form a triangle, and this triangle is
    similar to the first.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $W\subset \mathbb R^n$ be a subspace.  Show that
    $(W^{\perp})^\perp=W$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{On each face of a convex polyhedron consider an outward vector
    with length numerically equal to the area of the face.  Prove that
    the sum of all these vectors is equal to zero.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix of zeroes and ones that is
    symmetric (that is, $A_{ij}=A_{ji}$ for all $i,j$) and such that
    $A_{ii}=1$ for all $i$.  Show that there exists a subset of the rows
    of $A$ whose sum is a vector all of whose components are odd.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{In trapezoid $ABCD$, $AB||CD$, the midpoint of $\overline{AB}$ is $E$ and
    the midpoint of $\overline{CD}$ is $F$.  Let $G$ be the intersection of $\overleftrightarrow{AD}$
    and $\overleftrightarrow{BC}$ and $H$ the intersection of $\overleftrightarrow{AC}$ and
    $\overleftrightarrow{BD}$.  Show that the
    line $\overleftrightarrow{EF}$ passes through both $G$ and $H$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $P$ be a point on a given unit sphere.  Three mutually
    perpendicular rays from $P$ meet the sphere at $A$, $B$, and $C$.
    Prove that for all such triples of rays, the plane of $\triangle
    ABC$ passes through a fixed point.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{The vectors $\vec a$, $\vec b$ and $\vec c$ in $\mathbb R^3$
    satisfy \[\vec a\times \vec b = \vec b\times\vec c =

  [li]{{{Prove that the medians of a triangle form a triangle of $\frac
    34$ the area and with medians $\frac 34$ as long as those in the
    original triangle.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $k$ be a finite field (that is, a finite set with
    commutative, associative and distributive addition and multiplication with
    identities, additive inverses, and multiplicative inverses for
    nonzero elements).  Prove that there exists a prime $p$ and a
    nonnegative integer $r$ such that $|k|=p^r$.}}}[/li]
