[h2]Projective planes[/h2]

  Let's start with some general theory.  A [b]projective plane[/b] is any set $P$, which we call the set of [i]points[/i], and a nonempty collection $L$ of subsets of $P$ called [i]lines[/i], such that the following four axioms hold:
  
[b]P1:[/b] Every pair of distinct points are contained in exactly one line.

[b]P2:[/b] Every pair of distinct lines intersect in exactly one point.

[b]P3:[/b] There are four distinct points $a,b,c,d\in P$ no three of which lie on a line.

[b]P4:[/b] Every line contains at least three points.


 There are many interesting projective planes.  The smallest example of a projective plane is known as the [i]Fano plane[/i], or $F_7$, consisting of seven points and seven lines as shown below.

Notice the terms "point" and "line" are interchangeable in the axioms above.  We can in fact interchange the roles of points and lines in any projective plane to obtain another projective plane, called the "dual" projective plane.  
[b]Exercise 1.[/b] {{{What is the projective dual of the Fano plane?}}}
 The projective plane we'll be dealing with is the [i]real projective plane[/i], which is essentially the Euclidean plane plus a line at infinity.  Let's take a look.

[h3]The real projective plane[/h3]
 
The real projective plane was first defined by Desargues as an extension of the Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$ that forces parallel lines to intersect "at infinity", hence creating a plane that satisfies axiom [b]P2[/b] rather than the parallel postulate. \footnote{It may seem contradictory to require parallel lines to meet, but in fact it is a natural model of things we see in reality.  Suppose you are standing on train tracks and looking out towards the horizon along the direction of the tracks.  The tracks are parallel, but they appear to converge to a point on the horizon.  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is simply a local version of projective geometry; parallel lines are only truly "parallel" near your feet!}

Define a [i]pencil of parallel lines[/i] in $\mathbb{R}^2$ to be the set of all lines parallel to a given line in the plane.  Then the [b]real projective plane[/b] is the set $\mathbb{R}^2\cup l^\infty$ where $l^\infty$ is a set consisting of one point for each pencil of parallel lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$.  A [b]line[/b] in this plane is one of:
[ul][li]$l^\infty$,[/li]
  [li]Any subset of $\mathbb{R}^2\cup l^\infty$ consisting of a line in $\mathbb{R}^2$ along with the associated point in $l^\infty$.[/li][/ul]

[h3]Homogeneous coordinates[/h3]

There is another, more symmetric way to define the real projective plane.  We can think of a point in the real projective plane as a ratio $(a:b:c)$ of three real numbers, not all zero, called its [i]homogeneous coordinates[/i].  Since we only care about the ratio between the numbers, $(2:4:5)$ and $(6:12:15)$ describe the same point.

A [i]line[/i] is then defined as the set of solutions $(a:b:c)$ to a linear equation $$\alpha x +\beta y + \gamma z=0$$ for some fixed $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$.

[b]Exercise 2.[/b] {{{Can you see why these are equivalent ways of defining the real projective plane?  What are the points in $l^\infty$ in homogeneous coordinates?  The points in $\mathbb{R}^2$?}}}

[b]Exercise 3.[/b] {{{Show that the unit circle, expressed in homogeneous coordinates, is described by the equation $$x^2+y^2=z^2.$$  Why doesn't the equation $x^2+y^2=1$ make sense in the projective plane?}}}

[h3]Reciprocation (pole and polar)[/h3]

  Like the Fano plane, the real projective plane is self-dual.  How can we exchange the points and lines in such a way that collinearity becomes concurrency and vice versa?  The answer lies in the pole of a line and the polar of a point.

  [b]Polar:[/b] Fix a circle $\omega$ in the Euclidean plane with center $O$.  Let $A$ be any point in the projective plane, and let $A'$ be its inverse about $\omega$ (where all the points at infinity invert to $O$), and let $a$ be the line through $A'$ that is perpendicular to line $OA'$ (or $OA$, if $A'=O$).  Then $a$ is the [i]polar[/i] of $A$.

  [b]Pole:[/b] of a line $a$ is the reverse construction.  First, the pole of the line at infinity is $O$.  Now, given a line $a$ other than the line at infinity, let $A'$ be the foot of the altitude from $O$ to $a$ and let $A$ be the inverse of $A'$ about $\omega$.  Then $A$ is the [i]pole[/i] of $a$ (and $a$ is the polar of $A$.)

 [b]Exercise 4.[/b] {{{Show that $A$ lies on the polar of $B$ iff the polar of $A$ passes through $B$.}}}

  We now know that [i]reciprocation[/i], the transformation about a circle that replaces each point with its polar and each line with its pole, interchanges lines and points in a way that preserves indicence.  This enables us to "dualize" many theorems about concurrency to obtain a theorem about collinearity, or vice versa.

  Reciprocation has the added benefit that it preserves [b]conics[/b].  One way to define a conic is as the reciprocal of some circle.  Alternatively, we can define a conic as the locus of solutions $(a:b:c)$ to some homogeneous equation of degree $2$ in $x$, $y$, and $z$, such as $x^2+2y^2-z^2=0$ or $x^2-yz=0$.

[b]Exercise 5.[/b] {{{What kind of conics do the two quadratic equations above describe when restricted to the Euclidean plane ($c\neq 0$)?}}}

The following theorems should be kept in your toolbox at all times.  Can you see why reciprocation sends each theorem to its dual?

[b]Ceva's theorem:[/b]  If $ABC$ is a triangle, cevians $AY$, $BZ$, $CX$ concur if and only if $\frac{AX}{XB}\cdot\frac{BY}{YC}\cdot\frac{CZ}{ZA}=1$. 

[b]Menelaus's theorem:[/b] If $ABC$ is a triangle, points $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ on lines $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ respectively are collinear if and only if $\frac{AX}{XB}\cdot\frac{BY}{YC}\cdot\frac{CZ}{ZA}=-1$.




[b]Desargues' theorem:[/b] If $ABC$ and $DEF$ are two triangles, then $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent if and only if $AB\cap DE$, $BC\cap EF$, and $CA\cap FD$ are collinear. 

[b]Desargues' theorem:[/b] If $ABC$ and $DEF$ are two triangles, then $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent if and only if $AB\cap DE$, $BC\cap EF$, and $CA\cap FD$ are collinear. 



[b]Pascal's theorem:[/b] Given a hexagon inscribed in a conic, the intersection points of the pairs of opposite sides are collinear. 

[b]Brianchon's theorem:[/b] Given a hexagon circumscribed about a conic, the lines joining the pairs of opposite points are concurrent.


[h3]Projective transformations[/h3]

In homogeneous coordinates, a [i]projective transformation[/i] is a map of the form $$(x:y:z)\mapsto (ax+by+cz:dx+ey+fz:gx+hy+iz)$$ for some real $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i$.  The main facts we need to know about projective transformations are:

[ol]
  [li]Projective transformations send lines to lines and conics to conics.[/li]
  [li]Projective transformations preserve incidence (collinearity and concurrency).[/li]
  [li]Projective transformations preserve [b]cross ratios[/b] of collinear points.  (The [i]cross ratio[/i] of four collinear points $A,B,C,D$ is $$(A,B;C,D)=\frac{AC\cdot BD}{AD\cdot BC}.$$  Each factor is a directed length according to a fixed orientation of the line.)[/li]
  [li]Given four points $A,B,C,D$ in the projective plane, no three collinear, and another such choice of points $X,Y,Z,W$, there is a unique projective transformation sending $A$ to $X$, $B$ to $Y$, $C$ to $Z$, and $D$ to $W$.[/li]
[/ol]

It is often useful to choose an important line in a diagram and apply a projective transformation sending that line to the line at infinity.
