[h2]Pigeonhole[/h2]

The pigeonhole principle says 
[ul][li]If $n+1$ pigeons are put into $n$ holes then some hole has at least 2 pigeons.[/li]
  [li]If you put $kn+1$ pigeons into $n$ holes, then some hole has at least $k+1$ pigeons.[/li][/ul]
Pigeonhole can even be applied when there are an infinite number of pigeons! If you put an infinite number of pigeons in a finite number of holes, then some hole has an infinite number of pigeons. 

Pigeonhole may seem very simple, but it can be extremely useful and can be used in many interesting ways. Sometimes it is very clear what the ``pigeons'' and ``holes'' should be. Other times one will have to be creative and come up with the proper ``pigeons'' and ``holes''.

[li]{{{Consider that we have a $5\times 5$ board. In each square, there is a flea. At the same time all the fleas jump and move to a square which is adjacent to their current square. Is it possible that after they jump that all the squares have one flea on them?}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{If every pair of people are acquaintances or are strangers. Show that in any group of 6 people that there are 3 who all know each other or 3 who are all strangers.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{(Handshake Problem) At a party, everyone shakes hands with some other people at the party (possibly 0 people). Show that there are 2 people at the party who had the same number of handshakes.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{In a $2\times 2$ square, show that for any 5 points, there is a pair which are at most $\sqrt{2}$ apart.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{If $ABCDE$ is a convex pentagon with all its vertices on lattice points, prove that there exists a lattice point strictly in the interior of $ABCDE$.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{If $n+1$ numbers are selected from the set $\{1,2,\dots 2n\}$ show that there are two of them such that one divides the other.}}}[/li]
  [li]{{{Let $n$ be odd and $\pi$ a permutation of $\{1,2,\dots, n\}$. Prove that

  [li]{{{Given two disks, one smaller than the other. Each disk is divided into 200 congruent sectors. In the larger disk 100 sectors are chosen arbitrarily and painted red; the other 100 sectors are painted blue. In the smaller disk each sector is painted either red or blue with no stipulation on the number of red and blue sectors. The smaller disk is placed on the larger disk so that the centers and sectors coincide. Show that it is possible to align the two disks so that the number of sectors of the smaller disk whose color matches the corresponding sector of the larger disk is at least 100.}}}[/li]
