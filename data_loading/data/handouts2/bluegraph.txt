This handout is cribbed almost verbatim from a Kiran handout from
1996.  We start with a bunch of definitions.

[ul][li]A [i]graph[/i] is a pair $(V, E)$, where $V$ is a finite set and
  $E$ is a set of unordered pairs of elements of $V$. The elements
  of $V$ and $E$ are called [i]vertices[/i] and [i]edges[/i],
  respectively.[/li]
  [li]A [i]directed graph (digraph)[/i] is the same as a graph,
  except that the edges are now ordered pairs of distinct vertices.
  (An edge is said to "come out of" the first vertex in the pair
  and "go into" the second vertex.) When we say "graph", we mean
  an undirected graph unless otherwise specified.[/li]
  [li]An [i]isomorphism[/i] of two (directed or undirected) graphs is a
  bijection of their vertices such that two vertices of one graph
  form an edge if and only if their images form an edge (if the
  graphs are directed, the bijection must preserve orientation as
  well).[/li]
  [li]Two vertices are [i]adjacent[/i] if they are the endpoints of
  an edge.[/li]
  [li]The [i]degree[/i] of a vertex is the number of edges it is an
  endpoint of. In a directed graph, the [i]in-degree[/i] and {\em
  out-degree} of a vertex are the number of edges coming in and
  going out of, respectively, that vertex. A graph is {\em
  $k$-regular} if every vertex has degree $k$.[/li]
  [li]A graph is [i]connected[/i] if one cannot separate the vertices
  into two groups, such that every edge connects two vertices in the
  same group. Otherwise it is [i]disconnected[/i].[/li]
  [li]A [i]$k$-coloring[/i] of a graph is a partition of the vertex
  set into $k$ subsets, such that no two vertices in the same subset
  are adjacent. A [i]$k$-edge-coloring[/i] is a partition of the edge
  set into $k$ subsets, such that no two edges in the same subset
  have a common endpoint. A $2$-colorable graph is also said to be
  [i]bipartite[/i].[/li]
  [li]The [i]complete[/i] graph $K_n$ is the graph on $n$ vertices in
  which every pair of vertices is an edge. The [i]complete
  bipartite[/i] graph $K_{m,n}$ is the graph on $m+n$ vertices in which
  every pair of vertices, one from the first $m$ and one from the
  other $n$, is an edge. Similarly, the [i]complete multipartite[/i]
  graph $K_{m_1, \dots, m_k}$ is the graph on $m_1 + \cdots + m_k$
  vertices, containing every pair of vertices in distinct partitions
  as an edge.[/li]
  [li]A [i]planar[/i] graph is one that can be drawn in the plane,
  with points representing the vertices, and (polygonal) curves
  representing the edges, so that no two edges meet except at a
  common endpoint. The regions into which the edges divide the plane
  are called [i]faces[/i].[/li]
  [li]A [i]path[/i] is a sequence of distinct vertices such that
  every two consecutive vertices are adjacent. A [i]cycle[/i] is the
  same except that the first and last vertices are equal.  In a
  directed graph, paths usually travel in the direction of the edge
  orientations.[/li]
  [li]An [i]Eulerian tour[/i] is a path (but repeated vertices
  allowed) containing each edge exactly once.[/li]
  [li]A [i]Hamiltonian path/cycle[/i] is a path/cycle containing each
  vertex exactly once.[/li][/ul]


[b]Some Hard Theorems[/b]

[ul][li](Marriage theorem) Let $A,B$ be the color sets in a 2-coloring
  of a bipartite graph. We wish to choose a set of edges such that
  every vertex of $A$ lies on exactly one of the edges, but no
  vertex of $B$ lies no more than one. This is possible if and only
  if, for all $S \subseteq A$, the set of vertices adjacent to at
  least one vertex of $S$ contains at least as many elements as $S$.[/li]
  [li](Four-color theorem) Every planar graph is 4-colorable.[/li]
  [li](Cayley's formula) The number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices
  is $n^{n-2}$.[/li]
  [li](Turan's theorem) The maximum number of edges in a graph on
  $n$ vertices containing no $K_{k+1}$ occurs for the complete
  $k$-partite graph $K_{m_1, \dots, m_k}$, where $m_1 + \cdots + m_k
  = n$ and no two of the $m_i$ differ by more than 1.[/li][/ul]
