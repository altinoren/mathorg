Setting Up Radical Axes
=======================

Recall that the *power* of a point $P$ with respect to a circle
centered at $O$ with radius $r$ is defined to be the quantity
$PO^2 - r^2$.

1.  [[[Let $P$ be any point, let $\omega$ be a circle, and let
    $\ell$ be a line through $P$ that meets $\omega$ at
    $A$ and $B$. Show that if $P$ is on or outside the
    circle, then $PA \cdot PB$ is the power of $P$ with respect
    to $\omega$, and if $P$ is inside the circle, then
    $-PA \cdot PB$ is the power of $P$ with respect to
    $\omega$.]]]

2.  [[[Let $AB$ and $CD$ be any two line segments. Prove that
    $AB \perp CD$ if and only if $AC^2 - AD^2 = BC^2 - BD^2$.
    (This is a generally useful condition for perpendicularity.)]]]

3.  [[[Let $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$ be two circles, centered at
    $O_1$ and $O_2$, respectively. Show that the locus of points
    with equal power with respect to $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$
    is a line perpendicular to $O_1 O_2$.]]]

4.  [[[(Radical axis theorem) Let $\omega_1$, $\omega_2$, and
    $\omega_3$ be three circles. Show that the radical axis of
    $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$, the radical axis of
    $\omega_2$ and $\omega_3$, and the radical axis of
    $\omega_3$ and $\omega_1$ are concurrent.]]]

Basic Applications
==================

1.  [[[Determine the radical axis of two intersecting circles.]]]

2.  [[[Determine the radical axis two tangent circles.]]]

3.  [[[Suppose that $(x-h_1)^2 + (y-k_1)^2 = r_1^2$ and
    $(x-h_2)^2 + (y - k_2)^2 = r_2^2$ represent two circles in the
    Cartesian plane. Show that the difference of the equations of the
    two circles is the equation of the radical axis of the circles.]]]

4.  [[[Let $\omega_1,\omega_2$ be two circles intersecting at
    $S$ and $T$, and let $A,B$ be points on
    $\omega_1,\omega_2$ such that $AB$ is tangent to both
    circles. Show that $ST$ bisects $AB$.]]]

5.  [[[Use the radical axis theorem to prove that the orthocenter of a
    triangle exists. (Can you find three circles that pass through
    vertices of the triangle and the feet of the altitudes?)]]]

6.  Give a straightedge and compass construction of the radical axis of
    two circles.

Other Problems
==============

1.  [[[
    Let $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$ be circles with
    radii 15 and 13, respectively, and centers 26 apart. Suppose they
    intersect at points $A$ and $B$, and suppose line
    $\ell$, passing through $A$, intersects $\mathcal{C}_1$
    and $\mathcal{C}_2$ at $T_1$ and $T_2$, respectively, so
    that $A$ is between $T_1$ and $T_2$. Given that the
    point $P$ such that $PT_1$ and $PT_2$ are tangent to
    $\mathcal{C}_1$ and $\mathcal{C}_2$, respectively, lies on
    line $AB$, compute $\frac{T_1 A}{T_2 A}$.

    ]]]

2.  [[[
    (HMMT) In triangle $ABC$,
    $\angle ABC=50^{\circ}, \angle ACB=70^{\circ}$. Let $D$ be
    the midpoint of side $BC.$ A circle is tangent to line $BC$
    at $B$ and is also tangent to segment $AD$; this circle
    intersects $AB$ again at $P$. Another circle is tangent to
    $BC$ at $C$ and is also tangent to segment $AD$; this
    circle intersects side $AC$ again at $Q$. Find
    $\angle APQ$.

    ]]]

3.  [[[
    Let $\omega_1,\omega_2$ be two circles intersecting at $S$
    and $T$, and let $A,B$ be points on $\omega_1,\omega_2$
    such that $AB$ is tangent to both circles. Show that
    $AS/BS =AT/BT$.

    ]]]

4.  [[[
    $P, B, C$ are on a line in that order, and $A$ is point not
    on that line. Show that $PA$ is tangent to the circle passing
    through $A$, $B$, and $C$ if and only if
    $\frac{AB^2}{AC^2} = \frac{PB}{PC}$.

    ]]]

5.  [[[
    Let $ABC$ be a triangle. Points $A_1, B_1$, and $C_1$
    are chosen outside of $\triangle ABC$ so that $A_1B = A_1C$,
    $B_1 C = B_1 A$, and $C_1 A = C_1 B$. Show that the
    perpendicular from $A$ to line $B_1 C_1$, the perpendicular
    from $B$ to line $A_1 C_1$, and the perpendicular from
    $C$ to line $C_1 A_1$ are concurrent.

    ]]]

6.  [[[
    Let $ABC$ be an acute triangle, $M$ be the midpoint of
    $BC$ and $P$ be a point on line segment $AM$. Lines
    $BP$ and $CP$ meet the circumcircle of $ABC$ again at
    $X$ and $Y$, respectively, and sides $AC$ at $D$ and
    $AB$ at $E$, respectively. Prove that the circumcircles of
    $AXD$ and $AYE$ have a common point $T$, other than
    $A$, on line $AM$.

7.  [[[
    (USAMO 2009) Given circles $ \omega_1$ and $ \omega_2$
    intersecting at points $X$ and $ Y$, let $\ell_1$ be a
    line through the center of $ \omega_1$ intersecting
    $ \omega_2$ at points $ P$ and $ Q$ and let
    $ \ell_2$ be a line through the center of $ \omega_2$
    intersecting $ \omega_1$ at points $ R$ and $ S$. Prove
    that if $ P, Q, R$ and $ S$ lie on a circle then the center
    of this circle lies on line $ XY$.

    ]]]

8.  [[[
    (IMO 2008) Let $ H$ be the orthocenter of an acute-angled
    triangle $ ABC$. The circle $ \Gamma_{A}$ centered at the
    midpoint of $ BC$ and passing through $ H$ intersects the
    sideline $ BC$ at points $ A_{1}$ and $ A_{2}$.
    Similarly, define the points $ B_{1}$, $ B_{2}$,
    $ C_{1}$ and $ C_{2}$. Prove that the six points
    $ A_{1}$ , $ A_{2}$, $ B_{1}$, $ B_{2}$,
    $ C_{1}$ and $ C_{2}$ are concyclic.

    (ISL 2008) Let $ ABCD$ be a convex quadrilateral and let
    $ P$ and $ Q$ be points in $ ABCD$ such that $ PQDA$
    and $ QPBC$ are cyclic quadrilaterals. Suppose that there exists
    a point $ E$ on the line segment $ PQ$ such that
    $ \angle PAE = \angle QDE$ and $ \angle PBE = \angle QCE$.
    Show that the quadrilateral $ ABCD$ is cyclic.

10. [[[
    (ISL 2009) Let $ABC$ be a triangle. The incircle of $ABC$
    touches the sides $AB$ and $AC$ at points $Z$ and
    $Y$, respectively. Let $G$ be the point where the lines
    $BY$ and $CZ$ meet, and let $R$ and $S$ be points
    such that the quadrilaterals $BCYR$ and $BCSZ$ are
    parallelograms. Prove that $GR=GS$.
