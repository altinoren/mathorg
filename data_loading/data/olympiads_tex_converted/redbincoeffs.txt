**Binomial Coefficients**

**Definition** *The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ is defined
to be* \[\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.\]

The binomial coefficient $\binom{n}{k}$ can be understood as the
number of subsets of size $k$ of an $n$-element set (in other
words, the number of ways to choose $k$ objects from a collection of
$n$ objects). By way of convention, if ($k$ is an integer and)
$k<0$ or $k>n$, $\binom{n}{k} = 0$. Since the formula for
the binomial coefficient can be written as \[\binom{n}{k} =
\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!},\] we may think of the binomial
coefficient as a polynomial in $n$, in fact defined for all $x$.
The convention for $k>n$ as stated above is consistent with this.  

**Theorem 1 (The Binomial Theorem).** The following formula holds:
\[(x+y)^n = \binom{n}{0}x^n + \binom{n}{1}x^{n-1}y + \binom{n}{2}
x^{n-2}y^2 +\cdots + \binom{n}{n-1}xy^{n-1}+ \binom{n}{n} y^n.\]  

[[[*Proof.* Let us determine the coefficient of $x^ky^{n-k}$. If we
write out the product as \[(x+y)(x+y)(\cdots)(x+y),\] we can observe
that for each way of choosing $k$ of these multiplicands, there is a
contribution of 1 to the coefficient of $x^ky^{n-k}$, since we can
think of $x$’s from the chosen multiplicands being multiplied by the
$y$’s from those not chosen. Each contribution to the coefficient in
question arises uniquely in this way, and so we have identified the two
quantities, as we wanted.  
]]]

**Theorem 2.** *Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n
\ge k$. The following fundamental properties of the binomial
coefficients $\binom{n}{k}$ hold:* $\binom{n}{k} =
\binom{n}{n-k}$; $\binom{n}{k+1} = \binom{n-1}{k+1} +
\binom{n-1}{k}$; $\binom{n}{0} < \binom{n}{1} <
\binom{n}{2} < \cdots < \binom{n}{\Lc\frac{n-1}{2}\Rc} =
\binom{n}{\Lf\frac{n}{2}\Rf}$; $k\binom{n}{k} =
n\binom{n-1}{k-1}$; $k\binom{n}{k} =
(n-k+1)\binom{n}{k-1}$; $\binom{n}{0} + \binom{n+1}{1} +
\binom{n+2}{2} + \cdots + \binom{n+k}{k} = \binom{n+k+1}{k}$;
$\binom{n}{n} + \binom{n+1}{n} + \binom{n+2}{n} + \cdots +
\binom{n+k}{n} = \binom{n+k+1}{n+1}$; $\binom{n}{0} +
\binom{n}{1} + \cdots + \binom{n}{n} = 2^n$;
$\binom{n}{0} - \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n}{2} - \cdots +
(-1)^n\binom{n}{n} = 0$; $\binom{n}{1} + 2\binom{n}{2} +
3\binom{n}{3} + \cdots + n\binom{n}{n} = n2^{n-1}$; $\binom{n}{k}$
is divisible by $n$ if $n$ is prime and $1\le k \le
n-1$.

*Proof.* Routine, discussed in lecture.  

Binomial coefficients can be viewed as entries of Pascal’s triangle; the
entry in the $n^{\text th}$ row and $k^{\text th}$ column (where row and
column indexing starts at 0) is $\binom{n}{k}$.

[[[Now for some examples.]]]

**Example 1.** Ten points are marked on a circle. How many distinct
convex polygons of three or more sides can be drawn using some (or all)
of the ten points as vertices? (Polygons are distinct unless they have
exactly the same vertices.)  

**Example 2.**Evaluate
\[\frac{\binom {11}{0}}{1} + \frac{\binom {11}{1}}{2} + \frac{\binom
{11}{2}}{3} + \cdots + \frac{\binom{11}{11}}{12}.\]  

[[[**Example 3.**Let $n$ be a positive integer. Prove that
\[\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{(-1)^{k-1}}{k}\binom{n}{k} = 1 + \frac{1}{2}
+ \cdots + \frac{1}{n}.\]

[[[**Example 4.**Let $\{ F_n\}_{n=0}^{\infty}$ be the sequence
defined by $F_0 = F_1 = 1$ and $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} +
F_{n}$ for $n \ge 0$. Prove that
\[\sum_{k=0}^{n}\binom{n-k+1}{k} = F_{n+1}.\]

[[[**Example 5.**[Vandermonde] Let $m, n$, and $k$ be integers
with $m ,n \ge 0$. Prove that
\[\binom{m+n}{k} = \sum_{i=0}^{k} \binom{m}{i}\binom{n}{k-i}.\]  
]]]

**Theorem 3.**
\[\binom{n}{i} \equiv \prod_{j=0}^{m} \binom{n_j}{i_j} \pmod{p}.
\eqno{(**)}\] *Here $\binom{0}{0} = 1$ and
$\binom{n_j}{i_j} = 0$ if $n_j <
i_j$ by the convention we set earlier.*  

*Proof.* One good argument (which you should be able to work out on your
own) involves the identity \[(x+y)^p\equiv x^p + y^p \pmod{p}.\]  

One useful generalization of binomial coefficients are multinomial
coefficients. They are defined as \[\binom{n}{n_1, n_2, \dots ,
n_m} = \frac{n!}{n_1!n_2!\cdots n_m!},\] where $n_1+\cdots+n_m =
n.$ The above multinomial coefficient counts the number of ways of
partitioning an $n$-element set into parts of size
$n_1,n_2,\ldots,n_m$. As before, the convention is that if any of
the (integral) $n_k$ are negative then the multinomial coefficient
is $0$. The expected generalization of Theorem 1 above indeed
works:  

**Theorem 4.** & & (x<sub>1</sub>+x<sub>2</sub>++
x<sub>m</sub>)<sup>n</sup>  
& = & <sub>\\ n<sub>1</sub>+n<sub>2</sub>++n<sub>m</sub>\\ =\\ n</sub>
x<sub>1</sub><sup>n<sub>1</sub></sup>x<sub>2</sub><sup>n<sub>2</sub></sup>x<sub>m</sub><sup>n<sub>m</sub></sup>.  

*Proof.* Similar to the Binomial Theorem.
