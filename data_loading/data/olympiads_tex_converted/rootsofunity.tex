\ii How many $n$th roots of unity are primitive?
\ii Find the monic polynomial whose roots are the primitive 30th roots of unity.
\ii Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers, $\xi$ a primitive $n$th root of unity.  Compute, as a function of $n$ and $k$, the sum \[\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}\xi^{jk}.\]
\ii Let $\xi$ be a primitive 19th root of unity.  Compute \[\textrm{Re} \sum_{k=1}^{18}\xi^{k^2}.\]
\ii Let $\xi$ be a primitive 19th root of unity.  Compute \[\sum_{k=1}^{18}\xi^{2^k}.\]
\ii Let $n$ be a positive integer, $\xi$ a primitive $n$th root of unity.  Compute \[\prod_{k=0}^{n-1}(2+\xi^k).\]
\ii (IMO 1995/6) Let $p$ be an odd prime.  Determine the number of $p$-element subsets of $\{1,2,\ldots,2p\}$ whose sum is a multiple of $p$.
\ii Let $\mathbb N = S_1\cup S_2\cup\cdots\cup S_n$ be a (disjoint) partition of the natural numbers into finitely many arithmetic sequences (an arithmetic sequence is a set of integers of the form $\{a+bk|k\in\mathbb N\}$ for some integers $a$ and $b$ where $b$ is nonzero).  Prove that two of these arithmetic sequences must have the same common difference.
\ii Prove that \[\frac{1}{\sin(\pi/7)} = \frac{1}{\sin(2\pi/7)} + \frac{1}{\sin(3\pi/7)}.\]
