240	Use induction to prove that all horses have the same color.\n\n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Let us first prove the statement. For a positive integer $n$, let the $n$-th statement be:\n``Given any $n$ horses, they have the same color.'' It is clearly true for $n=1$. Assuming the statement for some $n$, let us consider what happens with $n+1$ horses. If we order them, the first $n$ will have same color by induction hypothesis. Similarly, the last $n$ will have same color. Hence, all the $n+1$ have the same color. By induction, $n$-th statement is true for all positive integers $n$ and since there are finitely many horses, they all have the same color.\n\n\nWhich one do you trust more: the proof above or your eyes? Which one of the following do you think is correct?\n(A) All horses really have the same color.\n(B) Base case is wrong.\n(C) Inductive step is wrong.\n(D) There are infinitely many horses.	\N	\N	\N	2015-08-22 00:20:48.805078	2015-08-22 00:20:48.812851	Problem from handout "Induction"	240	\N

Let $ABCDEF$ be a circumscribed hexagon, and let $PQRSTU$ be the inscribed hexagon such that $A'B'$ is tangent to $P$, etc. Move $A, B, C, D,  E, F$ alternately up and down out of the plane. Then $A, B, D, E$ are coplanar, so $AD$ and $BE$ must intersect. Thus $AD, BE, CF$ are skew lines that pairwise intersect, hence they must have a common intersection. Moreover, let $AB$ and $DE$ intersect at $L$, $BC$ and $EF$ intersect at $M$, and $CD$ and $FA$ intersect at $N$. Then $L, M, P, Q, B$ are coplanar, as are $L, M, S, T, E$.

669	Use induction to prove that $\\displaystyle 11\\times{80 \\choose 40}\\times2^{-80}<1$. (LHS turns out to be approximately $0.98$.)\n\n\n[b]Solution.[/b] We will induct on 40. First, let us consider how 11 depends on 40. Let $a_n=2^{2n}/{2n \\choose n}$. Then, investigating the small $a_n$'s we see that they grow at the rate of $\\sqrt{n}$. Let us use $11=\\sqrt{3\\times40+1}$. The problem states that $a_{40}\\geq11$ and we claim that $a_n\\geq\\sqrt{3n+1}$. $n=1$ case gives equality so we let the base case to be $n=2$ which gives $8/3>\\sqrt{7}$ which is true. The inductive step amounts to $4(n+1)^2(3n+1)\\geq(2n+1)^2(3n+4)$ after expanding which simplifies to $n\\geq0$. Thus, by induction, our statement is true for all $n\\geq2$ and in particular for $n=11$.	\N	\N	\N	2015-08-22 00:21:28.155554	2015-08-22 00:21:28.162118	Problem from handout "Induction"	669	\N

1935	The additive inverse of $f(x) =\n  a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots$ is just $-a_0-a_1x-a_2x^2-\\cdots$, as is\n  easy to verify; it is also easy to verify that this is unique.\n  Now suppose that a generating function\n  $f(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots$ has a multiplicative inverse\n  $g(x)=b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\\cdots$, so that $f(x)g(x)=1.$ Since the\n  constant term of $f(x)g(x)$ is $a_0b_0$, we must have $a_0b_0=1$,\n  so that $a_0\\neq 0$ is certainly a necessary condition for $f$ to\n  have a multiplicative inverse. Now, suppose $a_0\\neq 0$.  We know\n  that if a $g(x)$ as above exists, then $b_0$ must equal $1/{a_0}$.\n  Now, suppose we have defined all the $b_i$ for $i<n$.  By matching\n  coefficients of $x^n$, we see that \\[a_0b_n + \\sum_{k=1}^n\n  a_kb_{n-k} = 0,\\] so that $b_n$ is forced to be\n  \\[-\\frac{1}{a_0}\\sum_{k=1}^n a_kb_{n-k}.\\]  Therefore, only one\n  $g(x)$ can be the multiplicative inverse of $f(x)$, and this\n  $g(x)$ works by construction.	\N	\N	\N	2015-08-22 00:23:22.465469	2015-08-22 00:23:22.476122	Problem from handout "Generating Functions"	1935	\N

This is particularly useful when you need to prove that $I$ is the incenter or $I_a$ is the $A$-excenter: you don't have to prove that it's the intersection of two bisectors.	\N	\N	\N	2015-08-22 00:23:31.479065	2015-08-22 00:23:31.491614	Problem from handout "Triangles"	2021	\N

But this is easy since $\\cos A+\\cos B+\\cos C\\le3/2,\\cos A\\cos B\\cos C\\le1/8$.\n\nSOLUTION 2 by Virgil Nicula:\n\nI note the inradius $r'$ of a orthic triangle.\n\nMust prove the inequality $\\frac{r'}{R}\\le 1-\\frac 13\\left( 1+\\frac rR\\right)^2.$\n\nFrom the wellknown relations $r'=2R\\cos A\\cos B\\cos C$\n\nand $\\cos A\\cos B\\cos C\\le \\frac 18$ results $\\frac{r'}{R}\\le \\frac 14.$\n\nBut $\\frac 14\\le 1-\\frac 13\\left( 1+\\frac rR\\right)^2\\Longleftrightarrow \\frac 13\\left( 1+\\frac rR\\right)^2\\le \\frac 34\\Longleftri...$\n\n$\\left(1+\\frac rR\\right)^2\\le \\left(\\frac 32\\right)^2\\Longleftrightarrow 1+\\frac rR\\le \\frac 32\\Longleftrightarrow \\frac rR\\le...$ (true).\n\nTherefore, $\\frac{r'}{R}\\le \\frac 14\\le 1-\\frac 13\\left( 1+\\frac rR\\right)^2\\Longrightarrow \\frac{r'}{R}\\le 1-\\frac 13\\left( 1+\\frac rR\\r...$\n\nSOLUTION 3 by darij grinberg:\n\nI know this is not quite an ML reference, but the problem was discussed in Hyacinthos messages #6951, #6978, #6981, #6982, #6985, #6986 (particularly the last message). \n\n	IMO Shortlist 1993 Geometry	\N	\N	2015-08-22 00:26:01.784503	2015-08-22 00:26:02.158356		3103	90

3315	A pile of $n$ pebbles is placed in a vertical column. This configuration is modified according to the following rules. A pebble can be moved if it is at the top of a column which contains at least two more pebbles than the column immediately to its right. (If there are no pebbles to the right, think of this as a column with 0 pebbles.) At each stage, choose a pebble from among those that can be moved (if there are any) and place it at the top of the column to its right. If no pebbles can be moved, the configuration is called a final configuration. For each $n$, show that, no matter what choices are made at each stage, the final configuration obtained is unique.

An $A$-partition of $n$ into $k$ parts is a representation of n as a sum $n = a_1 + \\cdots + a_k$, where the parts $a_1 , \\cdots , a_k$ belong to $A$ and are not necessarily distinct. The number of different parts in such a partition is the number of (distinct) elements in the set $\\{ a_1 , a_2 , \\cdots , a_k \\}$.\nWe say that an $A$-partition of $n$ into $k$ parts is optimal if there is no $A$-partition of $n$ into $r$ parts with $r<k$.

[/li]\n  [li] [b]Ad hoc comparisons:[/b] Suppose $f$ is a function. The crux of smoothing is that pushing variables $x$ and $y$ together or apart can guarantee $f(x) + f(y)$ to increase or decrease. Knowing whether $f$ is convex can significantly facilitate smoothing, but analyzing the change of $f(x) + f(y)$ is possible even when, say, $x$ lies in a concave region of $f$ while $y$ lies in a convex region. In such a case, an ad hoc algebraic comparison could be used instead.

[/li]\n  [li] [b]Variable substitution:[/b] Smoothing works best when the variables have a fixed sum. If the variables satisfy some other sort of constraint, it can be helpful to perform a variable substitution such that the new variables have a fixed sum. For example, if we have variables $a,b,c$ subject to $abc = 1$, then if we perform the substitution $a = e^x, b = e^y, c = e^z$, our new constraint becomes $x+y+z=0$.

5	For a sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots$, the [i]generating function[/i] of that sequence is the series $a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \\cdots$. Generating functions are generally useful for two reasons: \n[ol]\n  [li]we can manipulate generating functions as [i]functions[/i] in ways we can't directly manipulate sequences of numbers. In particular, it often allows for a clear algebraic approach for dealing with sequences of numbers.[/li]\n  [li]if $a_0, a_1, \\ldots$ is a combinatorial sequence (i.e., if it is defined in terms of counting something), there might be a function constructed in such a way that its coefficients count the same objects for $a_0, a_1, \\ldots$ (This will be clarified in an example below.)[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nHere are some basic properties of generating functions. Let $A(x)$ be the generating functions of $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots$, and let $B(x)$ be the generating function of $b_0, b_1, b_2, \\ldots$\n[ol]\n  [li]For any constant $c$, the generating function of $c a_0, c a_1, c a_2, \\ldots$ is $c A(x)$.[/li]\n  [li]$x^k A(x)$ is the generating function of $\\underbrace{0, 0, \\ldots, 0}_k, a_0, a_1, \\ldots$[/li]\n  [li]The generating function of $a_0+b_0, a_1+b_1. \\ldots$ is $A(x) + B(x)$.[/li]\n  [li]The generating function of $a_0b_0, a_0 b_1 + a_1 b_0, a_0 b_2 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_0, \\ldots$ is $A(x)B(x)$.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nBelow are some examples of applications of generating functions: \n\n[b]Example 1.[/b] If $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots$ is a sequence with generating function $A(x)$, then the generating function of $a_0, a_0 + a_1, a_0 + a_1 + a_2, \\ldots$ is $\\frac{A(x)}{1-x}$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] The generating function of $1, 1, 1, \\ldots$ is $\\frac{1}{1-x}$. Multiplying this with $A(x)$ gives $a_0 + (a_0 + a_1) x + (a_0 + a_1 + a_2)x^2 + \\cdots$. \n\n[b]Example 2.[/b] Let $k$ and $n$ be positive integers. Show that the number of nonnegative integer solutions to the equation $a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_k = n$ is $\\binom{n+i-1}{i-1}$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] The number of such solutions is the coefficient of $x^n$ in $(1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots)^k$. (To see this, write out $1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots$ out $k$ times, and for each of the $k$ factors, we get one solution $(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_k)$ by choosing the $x^{a_i}$ from the $i$th factor of $1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots$ to contribute to the $x^n$th term.) Since $1 + x + x^2 + \\cdots = \\frac{1}{1-x}$, we seek the coefficient of $x^n$ in $\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k}$. We find this coefficient with the binomial theorem: \n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{1}{(1 - x)^k}\n&= (1-x)^{-k} = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{-k}{i} x^i (-1)^i \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(-k)(-k-1) \\cdots (-k-(i-1))}{i!} (-1)^i x^i \\\\\n&= \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{(k+(i-1))(k+(i-2)) \\cdots (k)}{i!} x^i = \\sum_{i=0}^{\\infty} \\binom{k+i-1}{i} x^k.\n\\end{align*}\nThe coefficient of $x^n$ is thus $\\binom{n+i-1}{i}$. \n\n[b]Example 3.[/b] Find a closed-form formula for the Fibonacci numbers. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Let $F(x) = F_0 + F_1 x + F_2 x^2 + \\cdots$. Note that \n\\begin{align*}\nF(x) \n&= F_0 + F_1 x + F_2 x^2 + F_3 x^3 + \\cdots \\\\\n&= x(1 + F_0) + (F_0 + F_1)x^2 + (F_1 + F_2)x^3 + (F_3 + F_4)x^4 + \\cdots \\\\\n&= x + (F_0 + F_1 x + F_2 x^2 + \\cdots)(x + x^2) = x + F(x)(x + x^2).\n\\end{align*}\nThus, $F(x)(1 - x - x^2) = x$, so $F(x) = \\frac{x}{1 - x - x^2}$. Now, decomposing $F$ using partial fractions, we find\n\\[ F(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\left( \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha_1 x} - \\frac{1}{1 - \\alpha_2 x} \\right) = \\sum_{k=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} (\\alpha_1^k - \\alpha_2^k) x^k, \\]\nwhere $\\alpha_1 = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\\alpha_2 = \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Thus, we have\n\\[ F_n = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}} \\left( \\left( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right)^n - \\left( \\frac{1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\right)^n \\right), \\]\nas desired. \n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n \n[ol] \n  [li][problem]63[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]64[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]65[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]66[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]67[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]68[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]69[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]70[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]71[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]72[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]73[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO) [problem]74[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]75[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	5	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:20:33.87404	2015-08-22 00:20:33.87404	\N

14	This handout will cover three common techniques for dealing with functional equations. \n\n[h2]Techniques[/h2]\n\n[h3]Injectivity / Surjectivity[/h3]\n\nA function $f$ is [i]injective[/i] if, whenever $f(a) = f(b)$, we have $a = b$. A function $f$ is [i]surjective[/i] if for all $r$ in the codomain of $f$, there is some $x$ such that $f(x) = r$. (So if $f$ is a real-valued function, $f$ is surjective if each real number is in the range of $f$.) \n\n[b]Example 1.[/b] The function $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies $x + f(x) = f(f(x))$ for every $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Find all solutions of the equation $f(f(x)) = 0$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] If $f(x) = f(y)$ for some $x$ and $y$, then $x = f(f(x)) - f(x) = f(f(y)) - f(y) = y$, so $f$ is injective. Setting $x = 0$ gives $0 + f(0) = f(f(0))$. Since $f$ is injective, this means $f(0) = 0$. Thus, $f(f(0)) = 0$, so $x = 0$ is a solution to $f(f(x)) = 0$. It is also the only solution, since $f(f(x)) = 0 = f(f(0))$ implies $f(x) = f(0)$, so $x = 0$.\n\n[b]Example 2.[/b] (ISL 2002) Find all functions $f$ from the reals to the reals such that \n  \\[ f(f(x) + y) = 2x + f(f(y) - x) \\]\n  holds for all real $x$ and $y$.\n\n[b]Solution.[/b] If $y = -f(x)$, then $f(f(-x) - x) = f(0) - 2x$. Since $f(0) - 2x$ is surjective, so is $f(x)$. Take $c$ so that $f(c) = 0$, and set $x = c$. We have $f(y) = 2c + f(f(y) - c)$. Since $f$ is surjective, $f(y)$ takes on all real values, so for all $z$, we have $z = 2c + f(z - c)$. Thus, $f(z) = z - c$ for all $z$. It is easy to verify that any function of this form satisfies the functional equation. \n\n[h3]Easy Values[/h3]\n\nWhen approaching a functional equations, there are a number of simple values that one should try substituting, like $x = 0$, $x = 1$, or $x = y$.\n \n[b]Example 3.[/b] Find all functions $f : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(xf(y)+y) = f(x)f(y) + y$ for all real $x$ and $y$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Substitute $x = 0$ to get $f(y) = f(0)f(y) + y$ for all $y$. Setting $y = 0$ yields $f(0) = f(0)^2$, so $f(0) = 0$ or $f(0) = 1$. If $f(0) = 1$, then $f(y) = f(0)f(y) + y = f(y) + y$ for all $y$, so $y = 0$ for all $y$, which is absurd. Thus, $f(0) = 0$, so $f(y) = y$ for all $y$. It is easy to verify that this function satisfies the functional equation. \n\n[h3]Cauchy's Equation[/h3]\n\nOften, functional equations get reduced to something of the form $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$. If some weak condition holds, we can conclude that $f(x) = cx$ for some constant $c$. In particular, if we can show that $f$ is continuous, that $f$ is monotonic over some interval, or that $f$ is bounded from above or below over some interval, then $f(x) = cx$ for all $x$. Here, we will show that if $f(x+y) = f(x) + f(y)$ and $f$ is increasing over $\\mathbb{R}$, then $f(x) = cx$ for some $c$. (The other cases are left as an exercise.)\n\nSetting $x=y=0$ gives $f(0) = 0$. For any positive integer $n$ and any real $x$, we have $f(\\underbrace{x + x + \\cdots + x}_n) = \\underbrace{f(x) + f(x) + \\cdots + f(x)}_n$, so $f(nx) = nf(x)$ for all positive integers $n$. Additionally, since $0 = f(-x + x) = f(-x) + f(x)$, we have $f(-x) = -f(x)$ for all $x$, whence $f(nx) = nf(x)$ for all integers $n$. Additionally, we have $f(n(x/n)) = n f(x/n)$, so $f(x/n) = f(x)/n$ for each integer $n$. It follows that for any rational $q = \\frac{m}{n}$, we have $f(qx) = f(mx/n) = mf(x/n) = (m/n)f(x) = qf(x)$. \n\nLet $c = f(1)$. We have $f(q) = qf(1) = cq$ for all rational $q$. Take any real number $x$. For any positive real number $\\epsilon$, we can find rationals $r$ and $s$ such that $r < x < s$, and $r,s \\in (x - \\epsilon/c, x + \\epsilon/c)$. We have $f(r) = cq \\leq f(x) \\leq f(s) = cs$. Thus, $c(q - x) \\leq f(x) - cx \\leq c(s - x)$. Since $|q-x| < \\epsilon/c$ and $|s - x| < \\epsilon/c$, we have $|f(x) - cx| < \\epsilon$. Since this holds for each positive $\\epsilon$, we must have $f(x) = cx$ for all $x$, as desired. \n\n[h3]Additional Tips[/h3]\n\n[ol]\n  [li]When you get a solution for the functional equation, don't forget to verify that the solution works.[/li]\n  [li]Often you will be able to deduce that a function $f$ satisfying the functional equation always equals one function or some other---say, you may deduce $f(x)^2 = x^2$, and conclude that for all $x$, $f(x) = x$ or $f(x) = -x$. From this, you cannot conclude directly that $f(x) = x$ for all $x$ or $f(x) = -x$ for all $x$.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n\n[ol] \n  [li][problem]227[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]228[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]229[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]230[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 2002) [problem]231[/problem][/li]\n  [li](EGMO 2012) [problem]232[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]233[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1992) [problem]234[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 2000) [problem]235[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 2008) [problem]236[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]237[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 2009) [problem]238[/problem][/li]\n  [li](ISL 2007) [problem]239[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	14	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:20:48.693635	2015-08-22 00:20:48.693635	\N

20	While a great range of techniques exist for dealing with problems involving integer polynomials, most basic integer polynomial problems can be solved by one of the following: \n[ul]\n  [li]working with the polynomial directly. This includes the standard techniques for dealing with polynomials, e.g., expanding a polynomial, looking at its coefficients, bounding it, factoring it, finding that it agrees with some other polynomial at infinitely many points...[/li]\n  [li]invoking the fact that if $P$ is an integer polynomial, then $a - b \\mid P(a) - P(b)$ for all integers $a,b$. Equivalently, if $n$ is a positive integer and $a,b$ are integers, then $a \\equiv b \\pmod{n}$ implies $P(a) \\equiv P(b) \\pmod{n}$. [/li]\n[/ul]\n\n[h2]Examples[/h2]\n\n[b]Example 1.[/b] (Rational root theorem) If $P(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \\cdots + a_0$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients, and $r = \\frac{p}{q}$ is a root of $P$, where $p$ and $q$ are coprime integers, then $q \\mid a_n$ and $p \\mid a_0$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] If $P(p/q) = 0$, then \n\\[ 0 = q^n P(p/q) = a_n p^n + a_{n-1} p^{n-1} q + \\cdots + a_0 q^n. \\]\nEach term on the right-hand side except $a_0 q^n$ is divisible by $p$, and 0 is divisible by $p$, so $a_0 q^n$ is divisible by $p$. Since $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$, we have that $p \\mid a_0$. Similarly, every term on the right-hand side except $a_n p^n$ is divisible by $q$, and 0 is divisible by $q$, so $a_n p^n$ is divisible by $q$. Since $\\gcd(p,q) = 1$, we have that $q \\mid a_n$, as desired. \n\n[b]Example 2.[/b] Show that if $P$ is a polynomial with integer coefficients such that $P(n)$ is prime for all integers $n$, then $P$ must be constant. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] We have that $(P(n) + n) - n$ divides $P(P(n) + n) - P(n)$ for all $n$, so $P(n)$ divides $P(P(n) + n) - P(n)$, i.e, $P(n)$ divides $P(P(n) + n)$ for all positive $n$. If $P$ is nonconstant, then there must be some $k$ for which $P(n) > 1$ for all $n \\geq k$. Define $a_0 = k$, and for each positive integer $n$, define $a_{n+1} = P(a_n) + a_n$. Note that $a_0 < a_1 < a_2 < \\ldots$. Since $P(a_n) \\mid P(a_{n+1})$ for each $n$, $P(m)$ is prime for all $m$, and $P(a_n) > 1$, we must have $P(a_n) = P(a_{n+1})$ for each $n$. Thus, $P(a_0) = P(a_1) = P(a_2) = \\cdots$, so $P$ attains the same value over an infinite set of integers. Since $P$ is a polynomial, this means that $P$ must be constant. \n\n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n\n[ol] \n  [li][problem]344[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]345[/problem][/li]\n  [li](AIME 2011) [problem]346[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]347[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]348[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1974) [problem]349[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]350[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]351[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]352[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1974) [problem]353[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 2006) [problem]354[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	20	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:20:58.232219	2015-08-22 00:20:58.232219	\N
21	Fermat's little theorem states that if $p$ is a prime, and $a$ is an integer not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$. Euler's theorem is a generalization, which states that if $n$ is a positive integer relatively prime to $a$, then $a^{\\phi(n)} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{n}$, where $\\phi(n)$ is the number of integers less than or equal to $n$ relatively prime to $n$. \n\nWe present two proofs of Fermat's little theorem. The first proof proceeds as follows. We first observe that for any integers $x$ and $y$, we have \n\\[ (x+y)^p = x^p + y^p + \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\binom{p}{k} x^k y^{p-k}. \\]\nNote that for $1 \\leq k \\leq p-1$, we have $\\binom{p}{k} = \\frac{p!}{k! (p-k)!}$. Since $p$ is prime, $p$ does not divide any term in the denominator, so $p \\mid \\binom{p}{k}$. Thus, \n\\[ (x+y)^p = x^p + y^p + \\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \\binom{p}{k} x^k y^{p-k} \\equiv x^p + y^p \\pmod{p}. \\]\nIt is sufficient to prove that $a^p \\equiv a \\pmod{p}$ for all positive $a$. We have\n$\\begin{align*}\na^p \n&= (\\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1}_{a})^p = (\\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1}_{a-1} + 1)^p \\equiv (\\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1}_{a-1})^p + 1 \\\\\n&= (\\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1}_{a-2} + 1)^p + 1 \\equiv (\\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1}_{a-2})^p + 1 + 1 \\\\\n&= \\cdots = \\underbrace{1 + 1 + \\cdots + 1}_a = a \\pmod{p}, \n\\end{align*}$\nas desired. \n\nThe second proof proceeds as follows. Consider the residue classes $\\{a, 2a, 3a, \\ldots, (p-1)a\\}$ modulo $p$. Each of these must be pairwise distinct, or else we have $p \\mid ai - aj = a(i-j)$ for some distinct $i,j$ with $1 \\leq i, j \\leq p-1$. But this is impossible, since $p$ is prime, $p \\nmid a$, and $p \\nmid i-j$. None of $a, 2a, \\ldots, (p-1)a$ are congruent to 0 modulo $p$ either. The only collection of $p-1$ distinct nonzero residue classes is $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\}$, so we must have that $\\{a, 2a, 3a, \\ldots, (p-1)a\\}$ and $\\{1, 2, \\ldots, p-1\\}$ are equivalent modulo $p$. Thus, their products are congruent modulo $p$, so $a^{p-1}(p-1)! \\equiv (p-1)! \\pmod{p}$, whence $a^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{p}$, as desired. \n\nThe second proof of Fermat's little theorem generalizes directly to prove Euler's theorem (where the residue classes considered are instead those coprime to $n$, rather than those from 1 through $n-1$), and is left as an exercise to the reader. \n\n[b]Example.[/b] Prove that if $p$ is an odd prime such that there exists an integer $n$ for which $p \\mid n^2 + 1$, then $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] If $n^2 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{p}$, then \n\\[ 1 \\equiv n^{p-1} \\equiv (n^2)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\equiv (-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} \\pmod{p}. \\]\nThus, $(-1)^{\\frac{p-1}{2}} = 1$, so $\\frac{p-1}{2}$ must be even, that is, $p \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4}$. \n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n  \n[ol] \n  [li][problem]355[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]356[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]357[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]358[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]359[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]360[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]361[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]362[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 2005) [problem]363[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 2005) [problem]364[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	21	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:20:59.689986	2015-08-22 00:20:59.689986	\N
22	As a warm-up, here are some classic problems that you may have seen before:\n\n[ol]\n\n[li][problem]365[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]366[/problem][/li]\n  \nThese two problems are in fact remarkably connected.  Let's now analyze the situation more closely.\n\n[li][problem]367[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]368[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]369[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]370[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]371[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]372[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1974/5) [problem]373[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]374[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]375[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]376[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]377[/problem][/li]\n  \nSo here's the punchline:\n\n[li][problem]378[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]379[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]380[/problem][/li]\n  \nWe've discovered a lot!  Let's summarize what we know.  Given a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths $a, b$ and $c$, we can construct\nan equilateral triangle $PQR$ and a point $M$ such that $MP=a$, $MQ=b$ and $MR=c$.  In fact, there are two such triangles an ``outer" one (problem\n9) and an ``inner" one (problem 10).  These are related to the outer and inner Napoleon triangles.  They are also related to the Fermat point.\n\n\nLet's rephrase this in another way.  Given an equilateral triangle $PQR$, and some triangle $ABC$ with side lengths $a, b$ and $c$, we can\nconstruct a point $M$ such that $MP:MQ:MR=a:b:c$.\n\n[li][problem]381[/problem][/li]\n  \nThis might lead us to consider the following problem: given three points in the plane, $P$, $Q$, and $R$, and three lengths $x, y$\nand $z$, when can we construct a point $M$ such that $MP:MQ:MR=x:y:z$?  Certainly Ptolemy's inequality implies that we need $QR \\cdot x + RP \\cdot y\n\\geq PQ \\cdot z$.  Is this sufficient?  It turns out it is.\n\n[li][problem]382[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]383[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]384[/problem][/li]\n  \nNow given $PQR$ and a point $M$ in the plane, how can we construct a triangle $ABC$ with side lengths proportional to $QR \\cdot PM$,\n$RP \\cdot QM$, $PQ \\cdot RM$?  One way comes from problem 1: we construct a point $S$ with $PSQ$ similar to $PMR$.  Then $QSM$ is the desired\ntriangle.  (Note that this was also how we proved Ptolemy's theorem.)\n\n\nAnother way to proceed is to drop perpendiculars from $M$ to $QR$, $RP$ and $PQ$ and let the feet of these perpendiculars be $A$, $B$ and\n$C$.  This will lead us to our next topic: the Miquel point.\n\n[li][problem]385[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]386[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Simson Line) [problem]387[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Miquel point) [problem]388[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]389[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]390[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]391[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]392[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]393[/problem][/li]\n  \nWe can quickly deduce the following facts. 1) The centers of any set of Miquel circles are vertices of a triangle similar to $ABC$. 2) Two or more directly similar triangles with corresponding vertices on the same sides of $ABC$ have the same Miquel point. 3) If three circles concur in a point, it is possible to start at any point of one of the circumferences ad draw a triangle whose vertices lies on the circles and whose sides\npass through the corresponding intersections; all such triangles are similar.

31	When trying to prove a property about a collection of objects, it is often helpful to consider the object that minimizes or maximizes some function. This technique is called the [i]extremal principle[/i]. We will illustrate this technique with an example. \n\n[b]Problem 1.[/b] There is a set of points in the plane, such that each point in the set is the midpoint of some two other points in the set. Show that this set is infinite. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Suppose for the sake of contradiction that this set is finite. Consider any two points $A$ and $B$ in the set whose distances from one another are maximal. Suppose that $B$ is the midpoint of $C$ and $D$, where $C$ and $D$ are points in the set. Since $\\angle CBA + \\angle ABD = 180^{\\circ}$, one of $\\angle ABD$ and $\\angle CBA$ is at least $90^{\\circ}$. If $\\angle ABD \\geq 90^{\\circ}$, then $AD$ is the longest side of $\\triangle ABD$, and thus longer than $AB$, so the length $AB$ is not maximal. If $\\angle CBA \\geq 90^{\\circ}$, then $AC$ is the longest side of $\\triangle ABC$, and thus longer than $AB$, so the length $AB$ is not maximal. This is a contradiction, so the set must be infinite. \n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n\n[i]Note: many of these problems are taken from \\emph{Problem-Solving Strategies[/i].}\n \n[ol] \n  [li][problem]516[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]517[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]518[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]519[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]520[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]521[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]522[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Putnam 1979) [problem]523[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Sylvester's theorem) [problem]524[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Dirac's theorem) [problem]525[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	31	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:21:16.69793	2015-08-22 00:21:16.69793	\N

34	[h2]Examples[/h2]\n\n[b]Problem 1.[/b] Show that if $x,y,z$ are integers such that $x^3 + 3y^3 = 9z^3$, then $x = y = z = 0$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the equation has a solution in which not all variables are 0. Let $(x,y,z)$ be any such solution with $|x| + |y| + |z|$ minimal. From $x^3 + 3y^3 = 9z^3$, we can see that $x$ is divisible by 3, so $x = 3x_0$ for some integer $x_0$. Substituting this in and dividing by 3, we get \\[ 9x_0^3 + y^3 = 3z^3. \\] It follows that $y$ is divisible by 3, so $y = 3y_0$ for some integer $y_0$. Substituting this in and dividing by 3, we get \\[ 3x_0^3 + 9y_0^3 = z^3. \\] We can see that $z$ is divisible by 3, so $z = 3z_0$ for some integer $z_0$. Substituting this in and dividing by 3, we get \\[ x_0^3 + 3y_0^3 = 9z_0^3,\\] so $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ is a solution to the original equation. But \\[ |x_0| + |y_0| + |z_0| = \\frac{|x| + |y| + |z|}{3} < |x| + |y| + |z|, \\] contradicting the minimality of $|x| + |y| + |z|$, so the only integer solution to the equation is $(0,0,0)$. \n\n[b]Problem 2.[/b] (IMO 1988) Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $ab+1$ divides $a^2 + b^2$. Prove that $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab + 1}$ is a perfect square. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer for which there exist positive integers $a,b$ such that $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab+1} = k$. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that $a \\geq b > 0$ and that $a+b$ is minimal among all pairs $(a,b)$ with $\\frac{a^2 + b^2}{ab + 1} = k$. \n\nWe have that $a^2 - (kb)a + (b^2 - k) = 0$. Consider the quadratic $x^2 - (kb)x + (b^2 - k) = 0$. One of its roots is $a$; let its other root be $r$. By Vieta's formulas, we have $a + r = kb$ and $ar = b^2 - k$. If $r > 0$, then we must have $a+r \\geq a+b$, since $a+b$ is minimal. It would follow that $r \\geq b$, and since $a \\geq b$ as well, we would have $b^2 - k = ar \\geq b^2$, which is impossible. Thus, $r \\leq 0$. \n\nIf $r < 0$, then $br + 1 \\leq 0$, whence $0 < b^2 + r^2 = k(br + 1) \\leq 0$, which is absurd. It follows that $r = 0$, so $k = b^2$, i.e., $k$ is a perfect square. \n\n[b]Remark.[/b] The crux of this solution is viewing the symmetric expression $a^2 + b^2 - k(ab + 1)$ as a quadratic in one of the variables and using Vieta's formulas to obtain another root of the quadratic. This trick is called [i]root flipping[/i] or [i]Vieta jumping[/i]. \n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n  \n[ol] \n  [li][problem]553[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]554[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1976) [problem]555[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]556[/problem][/li]\n  [li](PUMaC 2011) [problem]557[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1981) [problem]558[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]559[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 2007) [problem]560[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]561[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]562[/problem][/li]\n  [li](ISL 2002) [problem]563[/problem][/li]\n  [li](ISL 2009) [problem]564[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]565[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]566[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]567[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]568[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	34	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:21:20.262013	2015-08-22 00:21:20.262013	\N

36	[h2]Ceva's Theorem[/h2]\n\n[h3]Regular Ceva[/h3]\n\nCeva's theorem states that if $ABC$ is a triangle, and $D$, $E$, and $F$ are points on $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively, then segments $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent if and only if \n$\\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{BD}{DC} \\cdot \\frac{CE}{EA} \\cdot \\frac{AF}{FB} = 1. \\end{eqnarray}$\n\nI will first outline two proof of the only if direction. Suppose that $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ intersect at a point $P$. We wish to show that in this case, equation (1) holds. \n[ol]\n  [li]Find the ratio of the areas of triangles $ABD$ and $ADC$, and the ratio of the areas of triangles $PBD$ and $PDC$. Using this, determine the ratio $\\frac{[APB]}{[APC]}$, and use this ratio to prove equation (1).[/li]\n  [li]Let $\\ell$ be a line through $A$ parallel to $BC$. Let $BP$ and $CP$ meet $\\ell$ at points $Y$ and $Z$, respectively. Compute $\\frac{CE}{EA}$ and $\\frac{AF}{FB}$ in terms of ratios involving $AZ$ or $AY$.[/li]\n[/ol]\nNow for the other direction. Suppose that $D, E, F$ are points on the sides of $ABC$ so that (1) holds. Define $P$ to be the point where $BE$ and $CF$ intersect, and let $D'$ be the point where $AP$ meets $BC$. Use the only if direction of the proof to show that $D' = D$, and explain why this proves Ceva's theorem. \n\n[h3]Generalized Angle Bisector Theorem[/h3]\n\nThis result is not directly related to Ceva's theorem, but will often be helpful when chasing ratios of lengths. \n[ol]\n  [li]Let $ABC$ be a triangle, and let $D$ be a point on side $BC$. Show that \\[ \\frac{AC \\sin \\angle DAC}{AB \\sin \\angle BAD} = \\frac{CD}{DB}. \\][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h3]Trig Ceva[/h3]\n\nThere is an analogous statement of Ceva's theorem, concering the sines of the angles made by the cevians instead of the side lengths. If $ABC$ is a triangle, and $D$, $E$, and $F$ are points on $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively, then segments $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent if and only if \n$\\begin{eqnarray} \\frac{\\sin \\angle CAD}{\\sin \\angle DAB} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\angle ABE}{\\sin \\angle EBC} \\cdot \\frac{\\sin \\angle BCF}{\\sin \\angle FCA} = 1. \\end{eqnarray}$\nShow directly that equation (2) holds if and only if equation (1) holds using the generalized angle bisector theorem. \n\n[h2]Basic Applications[/h2]\n\n[ol]\n  [li][problem]594[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]595[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]596[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]597[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]598[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]599[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h2]Other Problems[/h2]\n\n[ol]\n  [li][problem]600[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]601[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]602[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]603[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]604[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Ceva nest theorem) [problem]605[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]606[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Jacobi's theorem) [problem]607[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 2011) [problem]608[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	36	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:21:23.476339	2015-08-22 00:21:23.476339	\N

38	In modern formulations of geometry, the projective space often\nplays a central role. These notes are to some extent about\ntransformations of one particular projective space, $\\mathbb{R} \\mathbb{P}^2$,\nbut are really about the way these transformations can tell us\nsomething about geometry in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the plane. Historically, the\nidea of projection was developed in the Renaissance by\nmathematicians and artists in order to accurately represent the\nway three-dimensional scenes are projected onto the cornea. We\nstart with a classical description of a projective transformation.\n\n[h2]Parallel Projection[/h2]\n\nA [b]parallel projection[/b] is a map between two planes $S$ and\n$T$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. One chooses a direction $\\hat{n}$ not parallel to\neither plane and maps a point $A$ on $S$ to a point $A'$ on $T$\nsuch that line $AA'$ is parallel to $\\hat{n}$.\n\nThis transformation is familiar to anyone who has looked closely\nat a sun shadow. Rays of light from the sun are effectively\nparallel, so the parallelogram shadow cast by a rectangular wall\nis its image under a parallel projection. This example\ndemonstrates several important properties of parallel projection.\n\n[ul][li]Parallel projection takes lines to lines and points to points.\nIf three points are collinear or three\nlines concurrent before parallel projection, their images will\nremain so.[/li]\n  [li]Parallel projection takes parallel lines to parallel lines.[/li]\n  [li]Parallel projection does [i]not[/i] preserve angles.[/li][/ul]\n\nSeveral other properties are not as obvious from our example but\nare nonetheless true, as we shall see.\n\n[ul][li]Parallel projection preserves ratios on a single line. That\nis, if $A,B$, and $C$ are collinear, then $AB/BC =  A'B'/B'C'$.\nThis is not true if the points are not collinear.[/li]\n  [li]Parallel projection takes ellipses to other ellipses. However,\ncircles are not taken to circles, except by trivial parallel\nprojections.[/li]\n  [li]Parallel projection takes parabolas to parabolas and hyperbolas to hyperbolas.[/li][/ul]\n\nOne technical note before we move on: We defined parallel\nprojection as between two distinct planes, but it's nicer to think\nof it as a map from the plane to itself. To make our definition\nfit, we have to map the figure back from the image plane to the\npreimage plane. We can do this by any similarity. The group generated by all parallel transformation is called the\ngroup of [b]affine transformations[/b]. Note that this group includes all similarities of\nthe plane. It is the group generated by linear transformations of the plane and translations.\n\n[h2]Central Projection[/h2]\n\nA [b]central projection[/b] is a map between two planes $S$ and\n$T$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$ given by choosing a point $P$ not on either plane and mapping a point $A$ on $S$ to the intersection of the line $PA$ and $T$.\n\n[ul][li]Central projection takes lines to lines and points to points and preserves colinearity and concurrence.[/li]\n  [li]Central projection does not preserve parallelism or angles.[/li]\n  [li]Central projection preserves cross ratios between four collinear points or four concurrent lines.[/li]\n  [li]Central projection preserves conics.[/li][/ul]\n\nCentral projections generate the group of projective transformations of the plane. Central projections do not, in general, preserve the line at infinity.\n\n[h2]Exercises:[/h2]\n\nGeneralities on projective geometry\n\n[ol]\n\n[li][problem]624[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]625[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]626[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]627[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]628[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n\nCross-ratios\n\n[ol]\n\n[li][problem]629[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]630[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]631[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]632[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]633[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]634[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n\nMain theorems\n\n[ol]\n[li][problem]635[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]636[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]637[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]638[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]639[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n\nMobius transformations\n\n[ol]\n\n[li][problem]640[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]641[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]642[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]643[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n\nConic sections (exercises from Geometry Revisited)\n\n[ol]\n\n[li][problem]644[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]645[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]646[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]647[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]648[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]649[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	38	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:21:26.866416	2015-08-22 00:21:26.866416	\N

44	Divisibility relations are ubiquitous in number theory, and knowing how to approach them is essential to having a strong foundation in number theory. Because of the wide range of contexts in which divisibility relations appear, the set of techniques with which to approach divisibility problems is very broad. This handout will cover a handful of these techniques---namely, [b]bounding[/b], [b]considering prime factors[/b], and [b]performing algebraic manipulations[/b]. The best way to improve at each of these techniques is simply by doing practice problems. \n\n[h2]Techniques[/h2]\n\n[h3]Bounding[/h3]\n\nSuppose that $a$ and $b$ are integers, and that $a$ divides $b$. Then either $b = 0$, or $|b| \\geq |a|$. In many cases, knowing that $|b| \\geq |a|$ is not immediately helpful. However, there are a few tricks that can make the bound more useful. For example, when $a$ divides $b$, we know that $a$ must also divide $b$ minus any multiple of $a$. The bound can often be more helpful when applied to such a difference. As another example, suppose that $b$ factors into a product $cd$, and that it can be deduced that $a$ divides one of $c$ or $d$. Then the bound provides more information when applied to $c$ or $d$, because $c$ and $d$ are smaller than $b$. \n\n[b]Example 1.[/b] Find all positive integers $n$ such that $n^2 + 1$ divides $n^3 + 3n + 1$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Since $n^2 + 1$ divides $n^3 + 3n + 1$, it must also divide $n^3 + 3n + 1 - n(n^2 + 1) = 2n + 1$. Since $n^2 + 1$ and $2n + 1$ are both positive, we must have $n^2 + 1 \\leq 2n + 1$, so $n \\leq 2$. Testing $n=1$ and $n=2$, we find that $n=2$ is the only solution. \n\n[b]Example 2.[/b] Let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers. Show that if $a + b$ is prime and divides $ab + 1$, then one of $a$ or $b$ must be 1. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] If $a+b$ divides $ab + 1$, it divides $ab + 1 + a + b = (a+1)(b+1)$. Since $a+b$ is prime and divides $(a+1)(b+1)$, it must divide $a+1$ or $b+1$, whence $a+b \\leq a+1$ or $a+b \\leq b+1$. It follows that one of $a$ or $b$ must be 1. \n\n[h3]Prime Factors[/h3]\n\nIf an integer $a$ divides an integer $b$, then each prime factor of $a$ divides $b$. Furthermore, $a$ divides $b$ if and only if the exponent of each prime dividing $a$ is at most the exponent of that prime in $b$. \n\n[b]Example 3.[/b] Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be positive integers. Show that $\\frac{(a+b+c)!}{a! b! c!}$ is an integer. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Let $p$ be any prime number. To show that $a! b! c!$ divides $(a+b+c)!$, it suffices to show that the sum of the exponents of $p$ dividing $a! b! c!$ is at most the exponent of $p$ dividing $a+b+c$ for each $p$. For any $n$, the exponent of $p$ dividing $n!$ is $\\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\lfloor \\frac{n}{p^k} \\rfloor.$ Thus, it is enough to show that \n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left \\lfloor \\frac{a+b+c}{p^k} \\right \\rfloor \\geq \\sum_{k=1}^{\\infty} \\left \\lfloor \\frac{a}{p^k} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{b}{p^k} \\right \\rfloor + \\left \\lfloor \\frac{c}{p^k} \\right \\rfloor. \\]\nTo prove this, it suffices to prove that $\\lfloor x + y + z \\rfloor \\geq \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\lfloor z \\rfloor$ for any real $x,y,z$, since we can then take $x = a/p^k, y = b/p^k, c/p^k$ and sum over all $k$. But \n\\[ \\lfloor x + y + z \\rfloor = \\lfloor \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\lfloor z \\rfloor + \\{ x \\} + \\{y \\} + \\{z\\} \\rfloor = \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\lfloor z \\rfloor + \\lfloor \\{x \\} + \\{y\\} + \\{z\\} \\rfloor \\geq \\lfloor x \\rfloor + \\lfloor y \\rfloor + \\lfloor z \\rfloor, \\]\nso we are done. \n\n[b]Example 4.[/b] Let $n$ be a positive integer. Show that if $n \\mid 2^n - 1$, then $n = 1$. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is some $n > 1$ such that $n \\mid 2^n - 1$. Let $p$ be the smallest prime divisor of $n$. Note that $p \\mid 2^n - 1$, and that $p \\mid 2^{p-1} - 1$ by Fermat's little theorem. Thus, $p \\mid 2^{\\gcd(n, p-1)} - 1$. But since $p$ is the smallest prime factor of $n$, and all prime factors of $p-1$ are smaller than $p$, we have that $\\gcd(n, p - 1) = 1$. Thus, $p \\mid 2^1 - 1 = 1$, which is a contradiction. \n\n[h3]Algebraic Manipulations[/h3]\n\nMany divisibility problems become more tractable when the expressions in the problem are manipulated, e.g., when some terms are factored or rearranged. \n\n[b]Example 5.[/b] Show that if $n$ is a positive integer and $2^n + 1$ is prime, then $n$ must be a power of 2. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $n$ is not a power of 2. Then $n$ can be written in the form $2^k m$ for some odd integer $m$. Since $m$ is odd, $a + 1$ divides $a^m + 1$ for each positive integer $a$. In particular, for $a = 2^k$, we get that $2^k + 1$ divides $2^n + 1$, so $2^n + 1$ cannot be prime, which is a contradiction. \n\n[b]Example 6.[/b] Show that for every natural number $n$, the product \n\\[ \\left( 4 - \\frac{2}{1} \\right) \\left(4 - \\frac{2}{2} \\right) \\cdots \\left(4 - \\frac{2}{n} \\right) \\]\nis an integer. \n\n[b]Solution.[/b] The product simplifies as follows: \n\\[ \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left( \\frac{2(2i - 1)}{i} \\right) = (2n-1)(2n-3) \\cdots (3)(1) \\cdot \\frac{2^n}{n!}  = \\frac{(2n)!}{(2n)(2n-2) \\cdots (2)} \\cdot \\frac{2^n}{n!} = \\frac{(2n)!}{n! n!} = \\binom{2n}{n}, \\]\nwhich is an integer. \n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n\n[i]Note: many of these problems were taken from \\emph{Problems in Elementary Number Theory[/i].}\n \n[ol] \n  [li][problem]730[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1972) [problem]731[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]732[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]733[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Putnam 1972) [problem]734[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1999) [problem]735[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1992) [problem]736[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]737[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 2002) [problem]738[/problem][/li]\n  [li](1998 Romanian TST) [problem]739[/problem][/li]\n  [li](ISL 2005) [problem]740[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	44	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:21:33.475479	2015-08-22 00:21:33.475479	\N

48	Let's warm up by reviewing some basic facts about power of a point.\n\nWhat are the possible values for the power of a point with respect to a circle? What is the locus of points with a fixed power with respect to a circle? Show that the power of a point outside of a circle is equal to $t^2$, where $t$ is the length of the tangent.\n\nConstruct the radical axis of two circles with a compass and straight-edge.\n\nHow do you calculate power of a point in co-ordinates? How do you calculate the radical axis of two circles in co-ordinates?\n\nWhat is the radical axis of two concentric circles? What is the radical axis of a line and a circle?\n\nWhat is the power of the incenter with respect to the circumcircle?\n\n[h4]What is inversion?[/h4]\n\nThere are many ways to define inversion, some of them quite\nbeautiful, but in terms of sheer usefulness there's none better\nthan the simplest. An [i]inversion[/i] in a circle $C$ with radius\n$r$ and center $O$ takes any point $P$ to another point $P'$ on\n$OP$ such that $OP \\cdot OP' = r^2$. The power of inversion is not\nobvious from this definition, but at least it's clear. Note that\nthe set of fixed points is precisely the circle $C$.\n\nThe first question that springs to mind about this transformation\nshould be: What happens to $O$? There's no line $OO$ and the\ninverse of the length of $OO$ is not defined. But if $O$ isn't mapped\nanywhere, that means nothing gets mapped to $O$ (an inversion is,\nappropriately enough, it's own inverse) and things start going\nbad. For example, what happens when two inversions are composed?\nDoes this new transformation have two points that don't go\nanywhere?\n\nTo solve the conundrum we need to extend our plane to include a\npoint that can be the image of $O$.\n\nThe [i]inversive plane[/i] is the standard plane with an\nadditional [i]point at infinity[/i] $\\omega$ added that lies on\nevery line and is infinitely far from every point. One way to think about this is through stereographic projection.\n\nThis alters one of the basic properties of plane geometry. In the\nbrave new world of the inversive plane every pair of non-parallel\nlines intersect in two points and every pair of parallel lines\nintersect in one point. This is reminiscent of the properties of\ncircles and there is indeed a deep connection between lines and\ncircles in the inversive plane. We call any line or circle in the\ninversive plane an [i]inversive circle[/i].\n\nWe can now clarify our definition of inversion by defining it on\nthe inversive plane and mapping $O$ and $\\omega$ to each other.\n\n[h4]First properties of inversion[/h4]\n\nThe fundamental property of inversion is simply that it maps\ninversive circles to inversive circles.\n\n[b]Exercise I1[/b] - Prove this statement. (One can do this using coordinates or by showing that the cross-ratio of four points is preserved by inversion. See below.) \n\nFind the conditions under which the following occur:[ol]\n  [li]A circle is mapped to a circle.[/li]\n  [li]A circle is mapped to a line.[/li]\n  [li]A line is mapped to a circle.[/li]\n  [li]A line is mapped to a line.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nExercise I1 makes clear the relationship between circles and\nlines, and is enough to demonstrate many correspondences between\nproperties of circles and lines. For example, parallel lines should be considered as\ntangent circles.\n\n[b]Exercise I2[/b] \n[ol][li][problem]813[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]814[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]815[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]816[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]817[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]818[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]819[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]820[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h4]Angles under inversion[/h4]\n\nLike reflection, inversion is orientation-reversing but otherwise\npreserves angles between lines. At first glance it may not be\nclear what that means, since lines don't necessarily end up as\nlines. By defining the angle between two circles to be the angle\nbetween their tangent lines that problem is solved and the more\ngeneral statement becomes clear: Inversion reverses all angles\nbetween inversive circles.\n\n[b]Exercise I3[/b] - Prove the previous statement. Show that angles (between two circles) are preserved under inversion. More precisely, the angle between two circles is reversed under inversion if we direct angles modulo $\\pi$. First consider the case of two lines, and finish the proof by observing that the property of tangency is preserved.\n\nAnother possibility is to show the following lemma: Let $C_1$ be an inversive\ncircle and $C'_1$ its inverse under an inversion with center $O$.\nIf $P$ is a point on $C_1$ with image $P'$, then the tangent to\n$C'_1$ at $P'$ is the reflection of the tangent to $C_1$ at $P$\nabout the perpendicular bisector of $PP'$.\n\n[b]Exercise I4[/b] - The angle between lines that pass through the\norigin seems to be preserved by inversion. Why does this not\ncontradict the previous exercise? \\sk\n\n[b]Exercise I5[/b] - Let $O, A, B$ be collinear. For any point $C$ not on line $AB$, show that $\\angle ACB = -\\angle A'C'B'$. \\sk\n\n[h4]Orthogonal Circles[/h4]\n\nOrthogonal circles have particularly nice properties under\ninversion. Because angles are preserved, orthogonal circles are sent to orthogonal circles. Thus any circle orthogonal to the circle of inversion is fixed.\n\n[b]Exercise I6[/b] - If circle $C_1$ is orthogonal to $C$, show that\nit is fixed by inversion in $C$. In addition, if $C_1$ and $C_2$\nare both orthogonal to $C$ and intersect at $X$ and $Y$, show that\n$X$ and $Y$ are inverses in $C$. This is one reason that inversion\nis sometimes called [i]reflection in a circle[/i]. Moreover, show that inversion in a circle $\\omega$ can be defined as the unique transformation taking circles orthogonal to $\\omega$ to themselves and exchanging the inside and outside of $\\omega$. Use this to define inversion in a line. \\sk\n\nThe above exercise allows us to define inversion purely in terms of circles, incidence and orthogonality. Thus inversion may be defined without appealing to the notion of distance.\n\nOne failing of inversion is that it doesn't deal well with the\ncenters of circles. This may seem strange because the circles\nthemselves are so well preserved under inversion, but\nunfortunately the center of a circle is not generally mapped to\nthe center of it's inverse. (In fact a good counterexample is the circle of inversion itself!) By symmetry, the two centers do line\non a line through the center of inversion, but the distances don't\nwork out correctly.\n\nOne way to get a handle on centers of circles is by observing that inversion in a circle $\\omega$ takes a circle $\\alpha$ and any pair of inverse points $P, Q$ in $\\alpha$ to $\\alpha'$ and $P', Q'$, where $P'$ and $Q'$ are inverse in $\\alpha'$.\n\nThe question of how many degrees of freedom are available in the\nset of inversions is a complicated one: the answer is\napproximately three. One of the most important degrees of freedom-related\ntheorems is that there exists an inversion mapping two given\nnonintersecting circles to concentric circles. This is\nparticularly interesting given the previous paragraph and offers\none more way to get a handle on the centers of circles using\ninversion. The next few exercises ask you to prove some\ndegrees-of-freedom-related theorems.\n\n[b]Exercise I7[/b] - Find an inversion that maps two given\nnonintersecting circles to concentric circles.\n\n[b]Exercise I8[/b] - Show that for many sets of three circles there\nis an inversion which inverts each one to itself. When is this not\ntrue?\n\n[b]Exercise I9[/b] - Show that any three points can be inverted to the vertices of a triangle similar to a given triangle. (Hint: If $A, B, C$ invert to $A', B', C'$ then $\\angle BOC=\\angle BAC + \\angle B'A'C'$.)\n\n[b]Exercise I10[/b] - Some more miscellaneous problems.\n\n[ol]\n[li][problem]821[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]822[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]823[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]824[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]825[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]826[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]827[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]828[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]829[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]830[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]831[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n\n[h4]Using Inversion[/h4]\n\nMost of the time, inversion can be used with the\n``invert-solve-uninvert'' strategy. By choosing a nice point to\ninvert about, inconvenient circles can become lines -- this is\nknown as the "busy point" method. The following problem is a\nclassic.\n\n[i]Problem[/i] - Cyclic quadrilateral $ABCD$ is given\nin the plane. Find the locus of points $X$ such that the\ncircumcircles of triangles $ABX$ and $CDX$ are tangent.\n\n[i]Solution[/i] - Invert the diagram about $A$. The\npoints $B',C',D'$ are collinear and we are looking for points $X'$\nsuch that the line $B'X'$ is tangent to circle $C'D'X'$. But by\npower of a point, $B'X'$ is tangent to circle $C'D'X$ if and only\nif $B'X'^2 = (B'C')(B'D')$ Thus all such $X'$ lie on a circle\ncentered at $B'$. The inverse of this circle, and the solution to\nthe problem, is therefore a circle or line. Since the circle is\northogonal to line $B'C'D'$, the inverse must be orthogonal to the\ncircle $ABCD$. Also, since the circle is centered at $B'$, it's\ninverse is centered at a point on $AB$. By a similar inversion\nabout $D$, that center must be on $CD$ as well, and therefore be\ncentered at the intersection of $AB$ and $CD$. If $AB$ and $CD$\nare parallel, the locus is the symmetry line of the figure. \\sk\n\nAnother common trick is to use inversion to pull far-apart angles\ntogether. Although the procedure may seem magical at first, after\na little practice it will be quite natural.\n\n[i](IMO 1996/2)[/i] - Let $P$ be a point inside\ntriangle $ABC$ such that\n$$\\angle APB - \\angle ACB = \\angle APC - \\angle ABC.$$\nLet $D$ and $E$ be the incenters of triangles $APB$ and $APC$\nrespectively. Show that $AP,BD$, and $CE$ meet at a point.\n\n[i]Solution[/i] - We simply need to prove that the\nangle bisectors of $\\angle ABP$ and $\\angle ACP$ hit line $AP$ at\nthe same point. By the angle bisector theorem, this is equivalent\nto the expression\n$$\\frac{BP}{AB} = \\frac{CP}{AC}.$$\nThe angle constraint is fairly ugly, so we invert about $A$ and\nproduce some similar triangles, namely $APC$ similar to $AC'P'$,\n$APB$ similar to $AB'P'$ and $ABC$ similar to $AC'B'$. Thus\n$\\angle APB = \\angle AB'P'$ and $\\angle ACB = \\angle AB'C'$\ntelling us that $\\angle C'B'P = \\angle AB'P' - \\angle AB'C' =\n\\angle APB - \\angle ACB$. Performing similar work on the other\nside of the angle constraint, and equating, we get $\\angle C'B'P =\n\\angle PC'B'$. Thus $B'P' = P'C'$ and using the inversive distance\nformula, we have \\beqa\nBP \\frac{r^2}{AB \\cdot AP} &=& CP \\frac{r^2}{AC \\cdot AP} \\\\\n\\frac{BP}{AB} &=& \\frac{CP}{AC} \\eeqa which is exactly what we\nwished to prove. \\sk\n\n[h4]Inversion and Complex Numbers[/h4]\n\n[b]Exercise I11[/b] - Relations between inversion and complex numbers:\n\n[ol]\n\n[li][problem]832[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]833[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]834[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]835[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]836[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]837[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h3]Problems[/h3]\n\nAll of these problems should be solved by using at least one\ninversion.\n\n[ol]\n\n\n\n[li][problem]838[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]839[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1995/3) [problem]840[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1993/2) [problem]841[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Pappus's Arbelos Problem) [problem]842[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1999/5) [problem]843[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]844[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]845[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 2009/1) [problem]846[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]847[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]848[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]849[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]850[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	48	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:21:42.54839	2015-08-22 00:21:42.54839	\N

53	Today, we focus on a key technique in solving combinatorial\nproblems.\n\n"In order to count the elements of a certain set, we replace them with\n  those of another set that has the same number of elements and whose\n  elements are more easily counted."\n\nThe following theorem is rather intuitive, but we will use it\n(implicitly) throughout.\n\n [b]Theorem 1.[/b] [i]Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets,\nand let $f$ be a function from $A$ to $B$. If $f$ is injective,\nthen there are at least as many elements in $B$ as in $A$.  If $f$\nis surjective, then there are at least as many elements in $A$ as\nin $B$.  Thus, if $f$ is bijective, then $A$ and $B$ have the same\nnumber of elements.[/i]\n\nThe remainder of today will be consumed with examples of problem\nsolutions using this approach (as well, sometimes, as others).\n\n [b]Example 1.[/b] Let $n$ be a positive integer. In how\nmany ways can one write a sum of (at least two) positive integers\nthat add up to $n$? Consider the same set of integers written in a\ndifferent order as being different. (For example, there are $3$\nways to express 3 as $3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 1 + 2$.)\n\nYou might think of this as an "easy" partition problem; a much\nmore difficult (and interesting) case is when you consider\nunordered partitions.\n\n [b]Example 2.[/b][AHSME 1992] Ten points are selected\non the positive $x$-axis, $\\bf{X}^+$, and five points are selected\non the positive $y$-axis, $\\bf{Y}^+$. The fifty segments\nconnecting the ten points on $\\bf{X}^+$ to the five points on\n$\\bf{Y}^+$ are drawn. What is the maximum possible number of\npoints of intersection of these fifty segments in the interior of\nthe first quadrant?\n\n\n[b]Example 3.[/b] \n[China 1991, by Weichao Wu] Let $n$ be an integer with $n\\ge 2$,\nand define the sequence $S = (1, 2, \\dots , n)$. A subsequence of\n$S$ is called arithmetic if it has at least two terms and it is an\narithmetic progression. An arithmetic subsequence is called\nmaximal if this progression cannot be lengthened by the inclusion\nof another element of $S$ (i.e. one cannot add additional elements\nof $S$ on either side and preserve that the sequence is\narithmetic). Determine the number of maximal arithmetic\nsubsequences.\n\nI believe you have seen the following before, but let us recall\nthe proof:\n\n [b]Theorem 2.[/b] [i]Let $m$ and $n$ be positive\nintegers.  [ol][li]There are $\\binom{n-1}{m-1}$ ordered\n  $m$-tuples $(x_1, x_2, \\dots , x_m)$ of positive integers\n  satisfying the equation $x_1 + x_2 + \\dots + x_m = n$.[/li]\n    [li]There are $\\binom{n+m-1}{m-1}$ ordered $m$-tuples $(x_1, x_2,\n  \\dots , x_m)$ of nonnegative integers satisfying the equation $x_1\n  + x_2 + \\dots + x_m = n$.[/li][/ol][/i]\n\n[i]Proof.[/i]  Routine.\n\n [b]Example 4.[/b] Setec Astronomy, Inc. has 15 senior\nexecutive officers. Each officer has an access card to the\ncompany's central vault. There are $m$ distinct codes stored in\nthe magnetic strip of each access card. To open the vault, each\nofficer who is present puts his access card in the vault's\nelectronic lock. The computer system then collects all of the\ndistinct codes on the cards, and the vault is unlocked if and only\nif the set of the codes matches the set of $n$ (distinct)\npreassigned codes. For security reasons (the company has too many\nsecrets), the vault can be opened if and only if at least six of\nthe senior officers are present. Find the values of $n$ and $m$\nsuch that $n$ is minimal and the vault's security policy can be\nachieved. (The elements in a set have no order.)\n\n\n[b]Example 5.[/b] \nA triangular grid is obtained by tiling an equilateral triangle of\nside length $n$ by $n^2$ equilateral triangles of side length 1\n(Figure 4.6).

56	[h2]Ways to Solve Recurrences[/h2]\n\n[h3]What is a Recurrence?[/h3]\nA recurrence is an equation which defines terms in a sequence based on earlier terms. Often times the first few terms (bases cases) will be defined explicitly. Many combinatorial problems are easier to solve by first finding the recurrence and then using it to find the answer. \n\n[h3]Make a Guess! (and Then Check!)[/h3]\nMany times your intuition will give you a reasonable guess at the solution to the recurrence. \n\nOften times in it's original form the recurrence may not give you any ideas.  So, you may want to try and give yourself some idea what is going on. A good start is to write out the first few terms and see if they are a sequence you are familiar with (i.e. squares Fibonacci).  Another technique is to try are to rewrite the recurrence by simplifying it. One way to do this is to take differences of the expression for $a_n$ and the expression for $a_{n+1}$. Another approach is to substitute one equation into another. \n\n[h3]Linear Recurrences[/h3]\nA linear recurrence has each term look like $ca_n$ where $c$ is a constant. So they can be written as:\n$$c_0a_n+c_1a_{n+1}+\\dots+c_ka_{n+k}=0$$\nIn this case we now guess that $a_n=x^n$ where $x>0$. Plugging this in we get the characteristic polynomial:\n$$c_0x^n+c_1x^{n+1}+\\dots+c_kx^{n+k}=0$$\n$$c_0+c_1x+\\dots+c_kx^{k}=0$$\n\nNow we just have a polynomial and we can solve for it's roots. Let the roots be $r_1, \\dots r_k$ (and for now we assume that the roots are distinct). Now we know that any solution to the recurrence looks like:\n$$a_n=\\sum_{i=1}^k b_i r_i^n$$\nusing the base cases we can solve for $b_i$ explicitly. \n\nIf $r_i$ is a root with multiplicity $m$, then we also have to consider that $n^jr_i^n$ are terms in the recurrence where $j <m$. \n\nBefore we assumed that the recurrence was homogeneous (the constant term is zero). In the case, where the recurrence is not homogeneous it will have the form:\n$$c_0a_n+c_1a_{n+1}+\\dots+c_ka_{n+k}=C$$\nThe solution to this will be the same as before just shifted by a constant.\n\n[h3]Generating Functions[/h3]\nAn ordinary generating function of the sequence $a_0,a_1, \\dots$ is the power series defined by:\n$$\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_ix^i$$\n\nThe main generating function to remember is the one for the sequence of all 1's:\n$$\\frac{1}{1-x}=1+x+x^2+x^3+\\dots$$\n\nWe can substitute the generating function into our recurrence to solve for the generating function. Once we have solved for the generating function we want to use partial fraction decomposition to break the generating function into parts we understand. Partial fraction decomposition involves breaking the function into pieces of the form $\\frac{c}{(1-kx)^n}$.  \n\n[h2]Examples[/h2]\n\n[h3]Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences[/h3]\nYou are probably most familiar seeing a arithmetic sequence written in the form $a_n=a+dn$. It can also be written as a recurrence where $a_0=a$ and $a_n=a_{n-1}+d$. Likewise a geometric sequence can be written either as $g_n=ar^n$ or as $g_0=a$ and $g_n=rg_{n-1}$. \n\n[h3]Towers of Hanoi[/h3]\n\nIn the game Towers of Hanoi, there are three rods and $n$ discs of distinct sizes. The discs start on the first rod sorted by size with the largest on the bottom. The goal of the game is to move all the discs from the first rod to the third rod. The only moves allowed are to move one disc from one rod to any other rod as long as it is not placed on a smaller disc. What is the minimum number of moves required?\n\nWe will let $h_n$ be the minimum number of moves required when there are $n$ discs. Clearly $h_1=1$ as we need at least move to get the disc from the first rod to third disc, and we can do it in one move. Now for $n \\geq 2$ we will consider what the largest disc must do. It must have all the $n-1$ discs on top of it moved from on top of it to the second rod so that it may be moved to the third rod. Then all the $n-1$ discs must be moved back on top of it. So we get the following recurrence:\n$$h_n=2h_{n-1}+1$$\nIf we solve for the first few terms in the sequence we get $1,3,7,15,\\dots$. Now one might guess that $h_n=2^n-1$, this can be verified by plugging it into the recurrence and checking the base case. \n\n[h3]The Fibonacci Sequence[/h3]\nThe Fibonacci sequence is defined to start as $F_0=0,F_1=1$ and any term is the sum of the two previous terms; $F_{n+2}=F_{n+1}+F_n$. What is the explicit formula for the Fibonacci numbers?\n\nFinding the characteristic polynomial we get $x^2=x+1$. The roots of this are $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2},\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$. Now we know:\n$$F_n=c_1\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n+c_2\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n$$\nSolving for $c_1, c_2$ with the initial constraints we get that $c_1+c_2=0$ and $c_1\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}+c_2\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}=1$. So we get that $c_1=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$ and $c_2=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}$. Therefore the Fibonacci numbers can be expressed as\n$$F_n=-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n+\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^n$$\n\n[h3]The Catalan Numbers[/h3]\nThe Catalan numbers $C_n$ count the number of ways to properly arrange $n$ open parenthesis ``(`` and $n$ close parenthesis ``)``. For example, ()()(()) and (()())are a proper arrangements whereas )(())( and ())(() are not. \n\nThe recursive formula for the Catalan numbers is $C_0=1$ and $C_{n+1}=\\sum_{i=0}^n C_iC_{n-i}$. We can use generating functions to solve for the explicit form. Let $C(x)$ be the generating function for the Catalan numbers. The sum here resembles a convolution of two sequences (the product of two generating functions) in this case the product is simply the convolution of $C(x)$ with itself. Putting in a $x^{n+1}$ term on both sides we get:\n$$C_{n+1}x^{n+1}=x\\sum_{i=0}^n C_ix^i C_{n-i}x^{n-i}$$\nNow we will sum over all possible $n$ and then plug in $C(x)$. \n$$\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty C_{n+1}x^{n+1}=x\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\sum_{i=0}^n C_ix^i C_{n-i}x^{n-i}$$\n$$C(x)-C_0=xC(x)C(x)$$\n$$xC(x)^2-C(x)+1=0$$\nSolving for $C(x)$ we get $\\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$. We know $C(0)=1$, therefore we know the correct form is $\\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}$.

57	[b]Definition[/b] [i]The binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ is\ndefined to be[/i] $$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.$$\n\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ can be understood as the\nnumber of subsets of size $k$ of an $n$-element set (in other\nwords, the number of ways to choose $k$ objects from a collection\nof $n$ objects).  By way of convention, if ($k$ is an integer and)\n$k<0$ or $k>n$, $\\binom{n}{k} = 0$.  Since the formula for the\nbinomial coefficient can be written as $$\\binom{n}{k} =\n\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!},$$ we may think of the\nbinomial coefficient as a polynomial in $n$, in fact defined for\nall $x$.  The convention for $k>n$ as stated above is consistent\nwith this.\n\n[b]Theorem 1 (The Binomial Theorem).[/b] The following formula\nholds:\n$$(x+y)^n = \\binom{n}{0}x^n + \\binom{n}{1}x^{n-1}y + \\binom{n}{2}\nx^{n-2}y^2 +\\cdots + \\binom{n}{n-1}xy^{n-1}+ \\binom{n}{n} y^n.$$\n\n[i]Proof.[/i] Let us determine the coefficient of $x^ky^{n-k}$.  If\nwe write out the product as $$(x+y)(x+y)(\\cdots)(x+y),$$ we can\nobserve that for each way of choosing $k$ of these multiplicands,\nthere is a contribution of 1 to the coefficient of $x^ky^{n-k}$,\nsince we can think of $x$'s from the chosen multiplicands being\nmultiplied by the $y$'s from those not chosen.  Each contribution\nto the coefficient in question arises uniquely in this way, and so\nwe have identified the two quantities, as we wanted.\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] [i]Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n\n\\ge k$.

63	Pell's equation is a tool that comes up quite often in olympiad-type diophantine equations.  The equation itself is simple: we let $D$ be a positive squarefree integer, and we look for solutions in positive integers $(x,y)$ to \\[x^2 - Dy^2 = 1\\qquad \\textrm{(Pell's equation)}.\\]  We will discuss variants below, but for now we consider this example alone.\n\nThere is a general solution to Pell's equation, but it is [i]implicit[/i] in the sense that there is no closed-form expression for $(x,y)$, only a method for calculating same involving a single formula.  There is a theorem that solutions to Pell's equation exist; therefore let $(x_1,y_1)$ be the solution with the smallest $x$-value (indeed, we can find this one by expanding $\\sqrt D$ in a continued fraction and take $x_1/y_1$ to be the first rational approximation that gives a solution).  The theorem states that all solutions to Pell's equation can be enumerated $(x_n,y_n)$, where \\[x_n + y_n\\sqrt D = \\left( x_1+y_1\\sqrt D\\right)^n.\\]  For example, to find solutions to \\[x^2 - 3y^2 = 1,\\] we notice that $(2,1)$ is a solution, and then the second solution is $(2+\\sqrt 3)^2 = 7+4\\sqrt 3$, i.e. $(7,4)$, the third $(2+\\sqrt 3)^3 = 26+15\\sqrt 3$, or $(26,15)$, and so on.\n\nThere are a few variants to Pell's equation, but the method of producing solutions is usually similar.  A good example is $x^2 - Dy^2 = -1$, which we consider in the exercises.  Note that [i]existence[/i] in these cases is no longer guaranteed in general, but if solutions exist they fall into families similar to that for the ordinary Pell's equations.\n\n\n[b]Problems[/b]\n\n[ol]\n  [li](QR) [problem]1120[/problem][/li]\n  [li](QR) [problem]1121[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1122[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1123[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1124[/problem][/li]\n  [li](MOP '98) [problem]1125[/problem][/li]\n  [li](MOP '09) [problem]1126[/problem][/li]\n  [li](MOP '97) [problem]1127[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1128[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1129[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	63	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:22:07.637211	2015-08-22 00:22:07.637211	\N
64	[b]Abstract.[/b] The intended audience should already familiar with Muirhead and Schur (e.g. the inequality $\\frac{a^3}{bc} + \\frac{b^3}{ca} + \\frac{c^3}{ab} \\ge a+b+c$ should be trivial).  This article is centered around two very powerful tools for solving polynomial-type inequalities: the SOS technique and Chinese Dumbass Notation.\n\n[h2]Introducing SOS[/h2]\n"[i]The whole point of SOS is so that you can use AM-GM backwards[/i]. \n--MOP 2012"\n\n[h3]A Motivating Example[/h3]\n[b]Example 1.[/b] For $a,b,c \\ge 0$, prove that \\[ \\frac{2}{3}(a^2+b^2+c^2)^2 \\ge a^3(b+c) + b^3(c+a) + c^3(a+b). \\]\n[b]Solution 1.[/b] Schurhead is not sufficient here.  Thinking wishfully, we can write down the two inequalities\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t\\frac{1}{2} \\left( a^4+b^4 \\right) &\\ge \\frac{1}{2} (a^3b+ab^3) \\\\\n\t\t2a^2b^2 &\\le a^3b + ab^3\n\t\\end{align*}\n\n\tThe cyclic sum of these two inequalities will yield the desired quantity.  Unfortunately, we're not allowed to add two different inequalities in different directions.  Or can we?\n\n\tRewrite the two inequalities as:\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t\\frac{1}{2} \\left( a^2+ab+b^2 \\right)(a-b)^2 &\\ge 0 \\\\\n\t\t(-ab)(a-b)^2 &\\le 0 \\\\\n\t\\end{align*}\n\n\tNow their "sum" is: \\[ \\frac{1}{2} (a^2-ab+b^2)(a-b)^2 \\ge 0 \\]\n\twhich is true!  [i]So our attempt to add two inequalities pointing in different directions has led to the identity:[/i]\n\t\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{cyc} (a^2-ab+b^2)(a-b)^2 \\ge 0 \\]\n\tand the problem is solved.\n\n\nThis is a strong way to motivate the method: by factoring out a square $(a-b)^2$, we can "measure" the strength of an inequality that we are trying to apply, and thus we may add and subtract these square weights without regards to direction.  \n\n[h3]The SOS Theorem[/h3]\nThe basic idea is to write an inequality in the form\n\\[ S_a (b-c)^2 + S_b (c-a)^2 + S_c (a-b)^2 \\ge 0. \\]\nIf it so happens that $S_a$, $S_b$ and $S_c$ are nonnegative, then we are done.  For sharper inequalities this may not be the case; however, most of the time we can still finish using some minor adjustments.  Some of the nicer estimates are provided below.  They are drawn from [sos].\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] (Pham Kim Hung) Consider the sum $S = S_a(b-c)^2 + S_b(c-a)^2 + S_c(a-b)^2$.  Then $S \\ge 0$ if any of the following take place:\n\t[ol][li]$S_a$, $S_c$, $S_a + 2S_b$, $S_c + 2S_b$ are all nonnegative.[/li]\n  [li]$S_b$, $S_a+S_b$ and $S_b+S_c$ are all nonnegative when $b$ is the median of $\\{a,b,c\\}$.[/li]\n  [li]$S_b$, $S_c$ and $b^2S_a + a^2S_b$ are all nonnegative when $a \\ge b \\ge c$.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[b]Proof 1.[/b] For the first part, the AM-GM $(a+c)^2 + (2b)^2 \\ge 4b(a+c)$ yields $(a-c)^2 \\le 2(a-b)^2 + 2(b-c)^2$.  If $S_b \\ge 0$ we are already done; else make the estimate\n\t\\begin{align*} \n\t\tS &\\ge S_c(a-b)^2 + S_a(c-b)^2 + \\left(2(a-b)^2 + 2(b-c)^2\\right) S_b \\\\ &= (S_c+2S_b)(a-b)^2 + (S_a+2S_b)(c-b)^2 \\\\ &\\ge 0.\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tFor the second part, we have $(b-a)(b-c) \\le 0 \\implies (a-c)^2 \\ge (a-b)^2 + (b-c)^2$, so we make the estimate}\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\tS &\\ge S_a(b-c)^2 + S_c(a-c)^2 + S_b\\left( (b-c)^2 + (a-c)^2 \\right) \\\\ &= (S_a + S_b)(b-c)^2 + (S_b + S_c)(a-c)^2 \\\\ &\\ge 0. \n\t\\end{align*}\n\tThe third part follows from observing that when $a \\ge b \\ge c$ we have $\\frac{a-c}{b-c} \\ge \\frac{a}{b}$, so that $(a-c)^2 \\ge \\frac{a^2}{b^2}(b-c)^2$.  Hence, we drop the $S_c(a-b)^2$ term to obtain}\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\tS &\\ge S_a(b-c)^2 + S_b(a-c)^2 \\\\\n\t\t&\\ge S_a (b-c)^2 + S_b \\left( \\frac{a^2(b-c)^2}{b^2} \\right) \\\\\n\t\t&= \\left( \\frac{b-c}{b} \\right)^2 \\left( b^2S_a + a^2S_b \\right) \\\\\n\t\t&\\ge 0.\n\t\\end{align*}\n\n[h2]Chinese Dumbass Notation[/h2]\nBefore proceeding further I would like to make sure the reader is acquainted with the extremely useful Chinese Dumbass Notation, as described in [cdn].  Chinese Dumbass Notation is a convenient way of presenting a polynomial inequality, making it significantly easier to find the suitable applications.\n\nThe idea is that the coefficients of an inequality of the form $P(a,b,c) \\ge 0$ are held in a triangle of side length $\\deg P + 1$, where the coefficient of the $a^x b^y c^z$ term are located at the point with [url=http://www.aops.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=475427]barycentric coordinates[/url] $(x:y:z)$.  Explicitly for, say, the third degree:\n\n\\[\n\t\\begin{array}[t]{ccccccc}\n\t\t&&& [a^3] &&& \\\\\n\t\t&& [a^2b] && [ab^2] && \\\\\n\t\t& [ab^2] && [abc] && [ac^2] & \\\\ {}\n\t\t[b^3] && [b^2c] && [bc^2] && [c^3]\n\t\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nTo further illustrate the point, here are some common inequalities:\n\n\\begin{fasy}\n\treal sep = 10;\n\tsize(15cm);\n\treal[] M = {\n\t\t0,\n\t\t0,0,\n\t\t0,0,0,\n\t\t1,-1,-1,1\n\t};\n\tdumbass(M,3,(0,7));\n\t// b^3+c^3 \\ge bc(b+c)\n\n\treal[] M = {\n\t\t1,\n\t\t-1,-1,\n\t\t1,-1,1\n\t};\n\tdumbass(M, 2, (10,7));\n\t// a^2+b^2+c^2 \\ge ab+bc+ca\n\n\treal[] M = {\n\t\t1,\n\t\t-1, -1,\n\t\t-1, 3, -1,\n\t\t1, -1, -1, 1\n\t};\n\tdumbass(M,3, (20,7));\n\n\n\treal[] M = {\n\t\t1,\n\t\t-2,0,\n\t\t1,0,0\n\t};\n\tdumbass(M,2, (0,0));\n\t// (a-b)^2 \\ge 0\n\n\treal[] M = {\n\t\t2,\n\t\t-3, -3,\n\t\t4, 0, 4,\n\t\t-3, 0, 0, -3,\n\t\t2,-3,4,-3,2\n\t};\n\tdumbass(M,4, (8,0));\n\t// The first example\n\n\treal[] M = {\n\t\t1,\n\t\t-1, -1,\n\t\t0, 1, 0,\n\t\t0, 0, 0, 0,\n\t\t-1, 1, 0, 1,-1,\n\t\t1,-1, 0, 0, -1,1\n\t};\n\tdumbass(M,5, (18,0));\n\t// Degree 5 Schur\n\n\t\\end{asy}\n\t\\caption{First row: $b^3+c^3 \\ge bc(b+c)$, $a^2+b^2+c^2 \\ge ab+bc+ca$ and 3rd degree Schur. Second row: $(a-b)^2 \\ge 0$, our first example, and 5th degree Schur.}\n\\end{fasy}\n\nWhat makes this notation powerful?  Once one recognizes Schur and AM-GM, then it is visually very easy to see how strong the inequality is.  Furthermore, if one is using SOS, then they can pull out things like $\\{1, -2, 1\\}$ and $\\{1, -1, -1, 1\\}$ from rows (things like the upper-left diagram).  One may also recognize $\\{1,-4,6,-4,1\\}$ as $(a-b)^4$.\n\nFinally, one can often use the identity\n$ a^3+b^3+c^3-3abc = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{cyc} (a+b+c)(b-c)^2 $\nto convert a $3$-variable application of AM-GM to SOS form.  But it is usually sufficient to just add/subtract things which are parallel to the sides of the triangle.\n\n[h3]Chinese Dumbass Notation: An Example[/h3]\nTo impress the usefulness of this notation, we provide an instructive example. \nThe unfamiliar reader is strongly encouraged to try and solve this problem (via expansion) before reading the solution below.\n\n[b]Example 2.[/b] (MOP 2011) Let $a,b,c$ be positive real numbers such that $a+b+c=3$.  Show that \n\t\\[ \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\ge 1 + 2\\sqrt{ \\frac{a^2+b^2+c^2}{3abc} }. \\]\n\n[b]Solution 2.[/b] Homogenizing and rearranging, this becomes\n\t\\[ \\left( \\left( a+b+c \\right) \\left( \\frac{1}{a} + \\frac{1}{b} + \\frac{1}{c} \\right) - 3 \\right)^2 \\ge 4\\left( \\frac{(a+b+c)(a^2+b^2+c^2)}{abc} \\right) \\]\n\tExpanding and clearing denominators, this reduces to\n\t\\[ \\sum_{sym} a^4b^2 + 2\\sum_{cyc} a^3b^3+ 6a^2b^2c^2 \\ge 2 \\sum_{cyc} a^4bc + 2 \\sum_{sym} a^3b^2c. \\]\n\tTrying to fight with this mess is no easy task.  But watch how easy the problem once we put in a triangle:\n\n\t\\begin{fasy}\n\t\tsize(6cm);\n\t\treal[] M = {\n\t\t\t0, \n\t\t\t0, 0,\n\t\t\t1, -2, 1,\n\t\t\t2, -2, -2, 2,\n\t\t\t1, -2, 6, -2, 1,\n\t\t\t0, -2, -2, -2, -2, 0,\n\t\t\t0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 0\n\t\t};\n\t\tdumbass(M, 6);\n\t\t\\end{asy}\n\t\t\\caption{K4.1 expanded}\n\t\t\\label{fig:blackcdn}\n\t\\end{fasy}\n\n\tIt's hard to see without the triangle, but now we notice that third-degree Schur appears upside-down!  The $\\{1, -2, 1\\}$ on each side also die off: so this problem is merely the identity\n\t\\[ \\sum_{cyc} a^4(b-c)^2 + \\sum_{cyc} ab(ab-bc)(ab-ac) \\ge 0. \\]\n\twhich is evident.\n\n\n[h2]Some Examples[/h2]\n[h3]SOS vs Schur[/h3]\n\n[b]Example 3.[/b] Let $a,b,c$ be nonnegative reals.  Show that $a^3+b^3+c^3+3abc \\ge a^2(b+c) + b^2(c+a) + c^2(a+b)$.\n\n[b]Solution 3.[/b] Double both sides and write the inequality in the triangle:\n\n\t\\begin{fasy}\n\t\tsize(4cm);\n\t\treal[] M = {2, \n\t\t\t-2, -2,\n\t\t\t-2, 6, -2,\n\t\t\t2, -2, -2, 2\n\t\t};\n\t\tdumbass(M, 3);\n\t\t\\end{asy}\n\t\t\\caption{Third-degree Schur}\n\t\t\\label{fig:deg3schur}\n\t\\end{fasy}\n\n\tWe can take out $\\sum_{cyc} a^3+b^3-a^2b-ab^2 = \\sum_{cyc} (a+b)(a-b)^2$ which will leave us a hexagon in the center; which we break up $-\\sum_{cyc} a(b-c)^2$.  Hence the original problem is equivalent to\n\t\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{cyc} (b+c-a) (b-c)^2 \\ge 0. \\]\n\tIf $a \\ge b \\ge c$ then it is trivial to see $S_b$, $S_b + S_a$ and $S_b + S_c$ are all nonnegative; hence we are done.\n\n[b]Exercise.[/b] [problem]1130[/problem]\n\nIn fact, upon discovering $(b-c)(b-a) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( (b-c)^2 + (b-a)^2 - (a-c)^2 \\right)$ for arbitrary $r$ the inequality may be written as\n\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{cyc} b^r \\left( (b-c)^2 + (b-a)^2 - (a-c)^2 \\right) = \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{cyc} (b^r+c^r-a^r)(b-c)^2. \\]\nwhich is obviously nonnegative by the SOS criteria.\n[h3]An Asymmetric Inequality[/h3]\n\n[b]Example 4.[/b] (Ukraine 2006) Let $a,b,c$ be positive reals.

All in all, the total is\n\t\\[ \\sum_{cyc} (13b+5c-3a)(b-c)^2 \\ge 0 \\]\n\twhich is not hard.\n\n\tTo be fair, the two triangles above are already nonnegative as is, meaning that simple AM-GM and Schur was sufficient.\n\n\n[h2]Too Lazy to Expand[/h2]\nUp to now, we have used SOS on an inequality only if it could be written in Chinese Dumbass notation.  In fact, with a bit more precision, one can use SOS on inequalities with fractions [i]without[/i] expanding.  An extremely useful fact is as follows:\n\n[b]Fact.[/b] If a polynomial expression $f(a,b,c)$ is\n\t[ol][li]symmetric in $a$ and $b$ (that is, $f(a,b,c) = f(b,a,c)$), and[/li]\n  [li]zero when $a=b$ (that is, $f(a,a,c) = 0$)[/li]\n[/ol]\n\tthen it is divisible by $(a-b)^2$.\n\nThis means that, for example, the expression $\\frac{a^2}{b+c} + \\frac{b^2}{c+a} - \\frac{4ab}{a+b+2c}$ is divisible by $(a-b)^2$: it's just a matter of computation to extract the factor.\n\n[h3]A Perfect Example[/h3]\n\n[b]Example 5.[/b] (Calvin Deng, ELMO Shortlist 2010) Let $a,b,c$ be positive reals.

Then we can drop the rightmost term $\\frac{(c-a)(c-b)}{2c^2+(a+b)^2} \\ge 0$, and this is what remains of the left-hand side.  But when $c = \\min \\{a,b,c\\}$ this is clearly nonnegative!\n\n[b]Proof 2.[/b] (Second Solution) We invoke the powerful identity we discovered earlier with Schur: \\[ 2(a-b)(a-c) = (a-b)^2 + (a-c)^2 - (b-c)^2. \\] \n\n\tUpon letting $X_a = \\frac{1}{2a^2+(b+c)^2}$ the inequality rewrites as\n\t\\[ \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{cyc} \\left( X_b+X_c-X_a \\right)(b-c)^2 \\ge 0 \\]\n\n\tIf $a \\ge b \\ge c$ then $X_a + X_c - X_b$ is evidently nonnegative.  (In fact, check that $X_c \\ge X_b$).

But this follows writing the inequalities $a+c \\ge b+c$ and $a^2(b^2+ca) \\ge b^2(a^2+bc)$ and multiplying them!\n\n[h2]The Ravi Substitution[/h2]\nWhen attacking a problem involving the sides of a triangle, it is often beneficial to delay the Ravi substitution until after the inequality has been written in SOS form.  Often by that point it is no longer necessary; especially with the following lemma:\n\n[b]Lemma 1.[/b] Let $a \\ge b \\ge c$ be the sides of a triangle. Then $S_a(b-c)^2 + S_b(c-a)^2 + S_c(a-b)^2$ is nonnegative whenever\n\t\\[ S_a, S_b \\ge 0  \\text{and}  b^2 S_b + c^2 S_c \\ge 0. \\]\n\n[b]Proof 3.[/b] Drop the $S_a(b-c)^2$ term.

66	[h2]Projective planes[/h2]\n\n  Let's start with some general theory.  A [b]projective plane[/b] is any set $P$, which we call the set of [i]points[/i], and a nonempty collection $L$ of subsets of $P$ called [i]lines[/i], such that the following four axioms hold:\n  \n[b]P1:[/b] Every pair of distinct points are contained in exactly one line.\n\n[b]P2:[/b] Every pair of distinct lines intersect in exactly one point.\n\n[b]P3:[/b] There are four distinct points $a,b,c,d\\in P$ no three of which lie on a line.\n\n[b]P4:[/b] Every line contains at least three points.\n\n\n There are many interesting projective planes.  The smallest example of a projective plane is known as the [i]Fano plane[/i], or $F_7$, consisting of seven points and seven lines as shown below.\n\n[Image missing]\n\nNotice the terms "point" and "line" are interchangeable in the axioms above.  We can in fact interchange the roles of points and lines in any projective plane to obtain another projective plane, called the "dual" projective plane.  \n[b]Exercise 1.[/b] [problem]1155[/problem]\n The projective plane we'll be dealing with is the [i]real projective plane[/i], which is essentially the Euclidean plane plus a line at infinity.  Let's take a look.\n\n[h3]The real projective plane[/h3]\n \nThe real projective plane was first defined by Desargues as an extension of the Euclidean plane $\\mathbb{R}^2$ that forces parallel lines to intersect "at infinity", hence creating a plane that satisfies axiom [b]P2[/b] rather than the parallel postulate. \\footnote{It may seem contradictory to require parallel lines to meet, but in fact it is a natural model of things we see in reality.  Suppose you are standing on train tracks and looking out towards the horizon along the direction of the tracks.  The tracks are parallel, but they appear to converge to a point on the horizon.  In this sense, Euclidean geometry is simply a local version of projective geometry; parallel lines are only truly "parallel" near your feet!}\n\nDefine a [i]pencil of parallel lines[/i] in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ to be the set of all lines parallel to a given line in the plane.  Then the [b]real projective plane[/b] is the set $\\mathbb{R}^2\\cup l^\\infty$ where $l^\\infty$ is a set consisting of one point for each pencil of parallel lines in $\\mathbb{R}^2$.  A [b]line[/b] in this plane is one of:\n[ul][li]$l^\\infty$,[/li]\n  [li]Any subset of $\\mathbb{R}^2\\cup l^\\infty$ consisting of a line in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ along with the associated point in $l^\\infty$.[/li][/ul]\n\n[h3]Homogeneous coordinates[/h3]\n\nThere is another, more symmetric way to define the real projective plane.  We can think of a point in the real projective plane as a ratio $(a:b:c)$ of three real numbers, not all zero, called its [i]homogeneous coordinates[/i].  Since we only care about the ratio between the numbers, $(2:4:5)$ and $(6:12:15)$ describe the same point.\n\nA [i]line[/i] is then defined as the set of solutions $(a:b:c)$ to a linear equation $$\\alpha x +\\beta y + \\gamma z=0$$ for some fixed $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$.\n\n[b]Exercise 2.[/b] [problem]1156[/problem]\n\n[b]Exercise 3.[/b] [problem]1157[/problem]\n\n[h3]Reciprocation (pole and polar)[/h3]\n\n  Like the Fano plane, the real projective plane is self-dual.  How can we exchange the points and lines in such a way that collinearity becomes concurrency and vice versa?  The answer lies in the pole of a line and the polar of a point.\n\n  [b]Polar:[/b] Fix a circle $\\omega$ in the Euclidean plane with center $O$.  Let $A$ be any point in the projective plane, and let $A'$ be its inverse about $\\omega$ (where all the points at infinity invert to $O$), and let $a$ be the line through $A'$ that is perpendicular to line $OA'$ (or $OA$, if $A'=O$).  Then $a$ is the [i]polar[/i] of $A$.\n\n  [b]Pole:[/b] of a line $a$ is the reverse construction.  First, the pole of the line at infinity is $O$.  Now, given a line $a$ other than the line at infinity, let $A'$ be the foot of the altitude from $O$ to $a$ and let $A$ be the inverse of $A'$ about $\\omega$.  Then $A$ is the [i]pole[/i] of $a$ (and $a$ is the polar of $A$.)\n\n\n[Image missing]\n\n [b]Exercise 4.[/b] [problem]1158[/problem]\n\n  We now know that [i]reciprocation[/i], the transformation about a circle that replaces each point with its polar and each line with its pole, interchanges lines and points in a way that preserves indicence.  This enables us to "dualize" many theorems about concurrency to obtain a theorem about collinearity, or vice versa.\n\n  Reciprocation has the added benefit that it preserves [b]conics[/b].  One way to define a conic is as the reciprocal of some circle.  Alternatively, we can define a conic as the locus of solutions $(a:b:c)$ to some homogeneous equation of degree $2$ in $x$, $y$, and $z$, such as $x^2+2y^2-z^2=0$ or $x^2-yz=0$.\n\n[b]Exercise 5.[/b] [problem]1159[/problem]\n\nThe following theorems should be kept in your toolbox at all times.  Can you see why reciprocation sends each theorem to its dual?\n\n[b]Ceva's theorem:[/b]  If $ABC$ is a triangle, cevians $AY$, $BZ$, $CX$ concur if and only if $\\frac{AX}{XB}\\cdot\\frac{BY}{YC}\\cdot\\frac{CZ}{ZA}=1$. \n\n[b]Menelaus's theorem:[/b] If $ABC$ is a triangle, points $X$, $Y$, and $Z$ on lines $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ respectively are collinear if and only if $\\frac{AX}{XB}\\cdot\\frac{BY}{YC}\\cdot\\frac{CZ}{ZA}=-1$.\n\n\n\n\n[b]Desargues' theorem:[/b] If $ABC$ and $DEF$ are two triangles, then $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent if and only if $AB\\cap DE$, $BC\\cap EF$, and $CA\\cap FD$ are collinear. \n\n[b]Desargues' theorem:[/b] If $ABC$ and $DEF$ are two triangles, then $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are concurrent if and only if $AB\\cap DE$, $BC\\cap EF$, and $CA\\cap FD$ are collinear. \n\n\n\n[b]Pascal's theorem:[/b] Given a hexagon inscribed in a conic, the intersection points of the pairs of opposite sides are collinear. \n\n[b]Brianchon's theorem:[/b] Given a hexagon circumscribed about a conic, the lines joining the pairs of opposite points are concurrent.\n\n\n[h3]Projective transformations[/h3]\n\nIn homogeneous coordinates, a [i]projective transformation[/i] is a map of the form $$(x:y:z)\\mapsto (ax+by+cz:dx+ey+fz:gx+hy+iz)$$ for some real $a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i$.  The main facts we need to know about projective transformations are:\n\n[ol]\n  [li]Projective transformations send lines to lines and conics to conics.[/li]\n  [li]Projective transformations preserve incidence (collinearity and concurrency).[/li]\n  [li]Projective transformations preserve [b]cross ratios[/b] of collinear points.  (The [i]cross ratio[/i] of four collinear points $A,B,C,D$ is $$(A,B;C,D)=\\frac{AC\\cdot BD}{AD\\cdot BC}.$$  Each factor is a directed length according to a fixed orientation of the line.)[/li]\n  [li]Given four points $A,B,C,D$ in the projective plane, no three collinear, and another such choice of points $X,Y,Z,W$, there is a unique projective transformation sending $A$ to $X$, $B$ to $Y$, $C$ to $Z$, and $D$ to $W$.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nIt is often useful to choose an important line in a diagram and apply a projective transformation sending that line to the line at infinity.\n\n[b]Exercise 6.[/b] [problem]1160[/problem]\n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n\n[ol]\n  [li][problem]1161[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1162[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1163[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1164[/problem][/li]\n  [li](b) [problem]1165[/problem][/li]\n  [li](China, 1997.)

How do you relate midpoints with angles? There are at least two possibilities:\n   [ul][li][b]Midlines.[/b] You should know that if $M$ and $N$ are the midpoints of segments $AB$ and $AC$ then $BC$ is parallel to $MN$.

You might want to take advantage of that.[/li]\n    [li]Another nice ratio is $2:1$: it is the centroid ratio.

This usually generates a lot of isosceles triangles, and you know good things happen when isosceles triangles are around.[/li]\n  [li][b]Circles with radius $0$.[/b] Sometimes it's handy to consider a point a circle with radius $0$. Especially if you apply power of a point.[/li]\n  [li][b]Segment ratios and angles.[/b] Suppose you have some segment ratios, but still have to deal with angles. One good bridge between these two apparently disparate worlds is the Apolonius circle: let $A$ and $B$ be two distinct fixed points; the locus of the points $X$ such that $\\frac{AX}{BX}$ is fixed and different from $1$ is a circle with $AB$ as an axis of symmetry.[/li]\n  [li][b]Point redefinition.[/b] You want a point to have a property, but can't get a proof of it!

69	The intention today is to tackle two hard questions from elementary number theory: the existence of a primitive root mod $m$, and the existence of a square root of a given residue class mod $p$.  Both were investigated at length by Gauss.\n\nRecall that a primitive root is a residue class $\\bmod m$ of order $\\varphi(m)$.  Such need not exist (and indeed does not in general); however given existence we get extra structure in mod $m$ arithmetic.\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] Suppose that $\\omega$ is a primitive root $\\bmod m$.  Then the sequence \\[\\omega,\\omega^2,\\ldots,\\omega^{\\varphi(m)}\\] runs through all relatively prime residue classes $\\bmod m$, each exactly once.\n\nIn other words, multiplication of relatively prime residues $\\bmod m$ becomes addition $\\bmod\\varphi(m)$.  This would be especially nice in the $\\bmod p$ case, where every nonzero residue class is relatively prime, and we will in fact show that in this case we always have a primitive root.\n\nWe need a technical result:\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] Let $m$ be a nonzero integer.  Then there is a residue class $\\omega \\bmod m$ whose order is a multiple of all other orders (though not necessarily equal to $\\varphi(m)$).\n\nUsing this, we can prove existence in a key case:\n\n[b]Theorem 3.[/b] Let $p$ be a prime.  Then there exists a primitive root $\\bmod p$.\n\nWe get a complete answer to our original question:\n\n[b]Theorem 4.[/b] Let $m$ be a nonzero integer.  Then there is a primitive root $\\bmod m$ if and only if $m=1,2,4,p^k,2p^k$, where $p$ is an odd prime and $k>0$ is an integer.  Additionally, if $\\omega$ is a primitive root mod $p^2$ (respectively $2p^2$), then $\\omega$ is a primitive root mod $p^k$ (respectively $2p^k$) for all $k>0$.\n\nSo ends the discussion of primitive roots.  We will use this new information to talk about the existence of square roots, or in other words the question of [i]quadratic residues[/i].\n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] Let $p$ be an odd prime.  A [i]quadratic residue[/i] $\\bmod p$ is a nonzero residue class $a$ such that there exists a solution to $x^2=a\\bmod p$.  If there is no such solution we say that $a$ is a [i]quadratic nonresidue[/i].  We write the [i]Legendre symbol[/i] like so, pronounced "$a$ on $p$:"\n\\[\\left(\\frac ap\\right) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \\textrm{if }a\\textrm{ is a quadratic residue}  -1 & \\textrm{if }a\\textrm{ is a quadratic nonresidue}  0 & \\textrm{if }a=0\\end{array}\\right.\\]\n\nThe Legendre symbol encapsulates the information of whether a given residue class is a quadratic residue.  Note that from yesterday's handout we know that for $p$ an odd prime, \\[\\left(\\frac {-1}p\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac {p-1}2}.\\]\n\nThe Legendre symbol has the nice property of being [i]multiplicative[/i]:\n\n[b]Theorem 5.[/b] Let $p$ be an odd prime, and let $a$ be an integer.  Then \\[\\left(\\frac ap\\right)\\equiv a^{\\frac {p-1}2}\\bmod p.\\]  In particular, the Legendre symbol is multiplicative; in other words, if $b$ is another integer then \\[\\left(\\frac ap\\right)\\left(\\frac bp\\right) = \\left(\\frac{ab}p\\right).\\]\n\nWith a bit of careful counting, the preceding theorem can be used to compute another class of Legendre symbols:\n\\[\\left(\\frac 2p\\right) = (-1)^{\\frac{p^2-1}8}.\\]\n\nWith more work, we may prove Quadratic Reciprocity, a surprising result due to Gauss.\n\n[b]Theorem 6.[/b] (Quadratic Reciprocity)  Let $p$ and $q$ be distinct odd primes.  Then:\n\\[ \\left(\\frac pq\\right)\\left(\\frac qp\\right) = (-1)^{\\left(\\frac{p-1}2\\right)\\left(\\frac{q-1}2\\right)}.\\]\n\nMultiplicativity and the three Legendre formulas comprise an effective algorithm for computing Legendre symbols in general, and so determining whether a given residue class is a square mod $p$.\n\n\n\n[h3]Problems[/h3]\n\n[ol]\n  \n  [li][problem]1206[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1207[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1208[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1209[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1210[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1211[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1212[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1213[/problem][/li]\n  [li](The Jacobi symbol) [problem]1214[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Gaussian modular arithmetic, continued) [problem]1215[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1216[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO) [problem]1217[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO) [problem]1218[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1219[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	69	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:22:16.443233	2015-08-22 00:22:16.443233	\N
70	[h2]Warmup[/h2]\n\n[b]Problem 1.[/b] (China 2004) [problem]1220[/problem]\n\n[h2]Useful Techniques[/h2]\n\nIn this lecture we discuss several more ad-hoc methods of attacking inequalities:\n\n[ul][li][b]Smoothing:[/b] Suppose you wish to prove an inequality of the form \n\\[\nf(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) \\geq C\n\\]\nwith the constraint $x_1 + \\cdots + x_n = k$.  If equality holds when all $x_i$ are equal, then, heuristically, you can try to make $f(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n)$ smaller by ``moving the $x_i$ together.'' Rigorously, this means showing inequalities of the form \n\\[\nf(x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n) \\geq f(k/n, x_1 + x_2 - k/n, \\ldots, x_n).\n\\][/li]\n  [li][b]Isolated Fudging:[/b] Given an inequality of the form \n\\[\nf(a, b, c) + f(b, c, a) + f(c, a, b) \\geq k,\n\\]\nwe can try to bound each term individually by \n\\begin{equation} \\label{fudge}\nf(a, b, c) \\leq \\frac{k\\, a^r}{a^r + b^r + c^r}\n\\end{equation}\nfor some $r$\\footnote{\nTo determine the value of $r$ to use, it is helpful to consider the behavior of (\\ref{fudge}) at the equality case $(a^*, b^*, c^*)$.  For values of $r$ and $k$ which work, we must have \n\\[[/li]\n  \\partial_a f(a^*, b^*, c^*) = \\left.\\partial_a \\left(\\frac{k\\, a^r}{a^r + b^r + c^r}\\right)\\right|_{(a^*, b^*, c^*)},\n\\]\nwhich is enough to uniquely determine $k$ and $r$.\n}.  More generally, it is useful to modify each portion of an inequality separately. \n\n[li][b]Ordering:[/b] It can be useful to assume an order on the variables in an inequality.  Suppose it is possible to write an inequality in the form\n\\[\nS_a(b - c)^2 + S_b(c - a)^2 + S_c (a - b)^2 \\geq 0\n\\]\nfor some $S_a, S_b, S_c$.  In this case, if the ordering $a \\geq b \\geq c$ induces an appropriate ordering on some linear functions of $S_a, S_b, S_c$, we may imitate the proof of Schur's inequality to obtain the result.[/li][/ul]\n\n[h2]Useful Facts[/h2]\n\nThroughout this section, we refer to [i]convex[/i] functions.  We say that $f$ is convex if $f''(x) \\geq 0$ for all $x$ or if \n\\[\n\\lambda f(x) + (1 - \\lambda) f(y) \\geq f(\\lambda x + (1 - \\lambda)y)\n\\]\nfor all $0 \\leq \\lambda \\leq 1$ and $x < y$.  We will also refer to the concept of [i]majorization[/i]; we say that the sequence $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ majorizes the sequence $b_1, \\ldots, b_n$ if $a_1 + \\cdots + a_i \\geq b_1 + \\cdots + b_i$ for $i < n$ and $a_1 + \\cdots + a_n = b_1 + \\cdots + b_n$.\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] (Weighted Jensen) Let $f$ be a convex function, $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ real numbers, and $a_1, \\ldots, a_n$ non-negative reals with $a_1 + \\cdots + a_n = 1$.  Then, we have \n\\[\na_1 f(x_1) + \\cdots + a_n f(x_n) \\geq f\\left(a_1 x_1 + \\cdots + a_n x_n\\right).\n\\]\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] (Karamata) Let $f$ be convex.  Then, for $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$ and $y_1, \\ldots, y_n$ such that the $\\{x_i\\}$ majorize the $\\{y_i\\}$, we have \n\\[\nf(x_1) + \\cdots + f(x_n) \\geq f(y_1) + \\cdots + f(y_n).\n\\]\n\n[b]Theorem 3.[/b] (Schur) For non-negative reals $x, y, z$ and $r > 0$, we have\n\\[\nx^r(x - y)(x - z) + y^r(y - x)(y - z) + z^r(z - x)(z - y) \\geq 0\n\\]\nwhere equality holds if $x = y = z$ or $\\{x, y, z\\} = \\{0, a, a\\}$ for some $a$.\n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n\n[h3]Smoothing[/h3]\n\n[b]Problem 2.[/b] (USAMO 1980) [problem]1221[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 3.[/b] (USAMO 1999) [problem]1222[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 4.[/b] (USAMO 1998) [problem]1223[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 5.[/b] (IMO 1974) [problem]1224[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 6.[/b] (MOP 2012) [problem]1225[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 7.[/b] (Vietnam 1998) [problem]1226[/problem]\n\n[h3]Fudging[/h3]\n\n[b]Problem 8.[/b] (MOP 2002) [problem]1227[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 9.[/b] (IMO 2001) [problem]1228[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 10.[/b] (USAMO 2004) [problem]1229[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 11.[/b] (USAMO 2003) [problem]1230[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 12.[/b] (IMO 2005) [problem]1231[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 13.[/b] (Japan 1997) [problem]1232[/problem]\n\n[h3]Ordering[/h3]\n\n[b]Problem 14.[/b] [problem]1233[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 15.[/b] (USAMO 2001) [problem]1234[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 16.[/b] [problem]1235[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 17.[/b] (TST 2009) [problem]1236[/problem]\n\n[h3]Bonus Weird Inequalities[/h3]\n\n[b]Problem 18.[/b] (ISL 2001) [problem]1237[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 19.[/b] (IMO 2004) [problem]1238[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 20.[/b] (Russia 2004) [problem]1239[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 21.[/b] (Romania 2004) [problem]1240[/problem]	70	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:22:18.058313	2015-08-22 00:22:18.058313	\N

76	[b]Abstract.[/b] Some tips on proving that lines are concurrent or points are collinear.\n\nThere are many, many ways to prove that lines are concurrent and points are collinear. Here are some ways, but be aware that there are many others (like, for instance, projective geometry in general).\n\n[h2]Collinearity[/h2]\n[h3]Menelaus' theorem[/h3]\nLet $ABC$ be a triangle and $P$, $Q$, $R$ be points on lines $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Then $P$, $Q$ and $R$ are collinear if and only if\n$$\\frac{BP}{PC}\\cdot \\frac{CQ}{QA}\\cdot \\frac{AR}{RB} = -1.$$\n\n[h3]Pappus' theorem[/h3]\nLet $A_1,A_2,A_3$ be points in a line $r$ and $B_1,B_2,B_3$ points in a line $s$. Then $A_1B_2\\cap A_2B_1$, $A_1B_3\\cap A_3B_1$ and $A_2B_3\\cap A_3B_2$ are collinear.\n\n[h3]Pascal's theorem[/h3]\nLet $ABCDEF$ be a hexagon inscribed in a circle. Then the intersections of opposite sides $AB\\cap DE$, $BC\\cap EF$ and $CD\\cap FA$ are collinear. The hexagon doesn't need to be convex, and degenerate cases (for example, $A=B$) are allowed (in the mentioned case, $AB = AA$ is the tangent line through $A$).\n\n[h2]Concurrency[/h2]\n[h3]Ceva's theorem[/h3]\nLet $ABC$ be a triangle and $P$, $Q$, $R$ be points on lines $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Then $AP$, $BQ$ and $CR$ are concurrent if and only if\n$$\\frac{BP}{PC}\\cdot \\frac{CQ}{QA}\\cdot \\frac{AR}{RB} = 1.$$\n\nThis also holds if some points are on extensions of sides.\n\n[h3]Trig Ceva[/h3]\nLet $ABC$ be a triangle and $P$, $Q$, $R$ be points on lines $BC$, $CA$ and $AB$, respectively. Then $AP$, $BQ$ and $CR$ are concurrent if and only if\n$$\\frac{\\sin\\angle BAP}{\\sin\\angle PAC}\\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\angle CBQ}{\\sin\\angle QBA}\\cdot \\frac{\\sin\\angle ACR}{\\sin\\angle RCB} = 1.$$\n\nThis also holds if some points are on extensions of sides.\n\n[h3]Brianchon's theorem[/h3]\nLet $ABCDEF$ be a hexagon circumscribed to a circle. Then the lines connecting opposite vertices, that is, $AD$, $BE$ and $CF$, are concurrent. The hexagon doesn't need to be convex, and degenerate cases are allowed.\n\n[h3]Radical axes and center[/h3]\nLet $\\Gamma_1$, $\\Gamma_2$ and $\\Gamma_3$. Then the radical axes of $\\Gamma_1,\\Gamma_2$, $\\Gamma_2,\\Gamma_3$ and $\\Gamma_3,\\Gamma_1$ are either all parallel or concurrent at the radical center of the three circles.\n\n[h2]Collinearity and concurrency[/h2]\n[h3]Desargues' theorem[/h3]\nLet $A_1B_1C_1$ and $A_2B_2C_2$ be triangles in space (yes, this works in 3D!). Then the lines connecting corresponding vertices $A_1A_2$, $B_1B_2$, $C_1C_2$ are concurrent (or all parallel) if and only if the intersections of corresponding sides $A_1B_1\\cap A_2B_2$, $A_1C_1\\cap A_2C_2$ and $B_1C_1\\cap B_2C_2$ are collinear.\n\n[h3]Homothety[/h3]\n[ul][li]If two diagrams are homothetic then all lines connecting corresponding points are concurrent at the homothety center.[/li]\n  [li]In a homothety, the homothety center and two corresponding points are collinear.[/li][/ul]\n\n[h3]Composition of homotheties[/h3]\nIf $\\sigma_1$ and $\\sigma_2$ are homotheties with center $O_1,O_2$ respectively and ratios $k_1,k_2$ respectively ($k_1,k_2$ might be negative), $k_1k_2\\neq 1$, then the composition $\\sigma_1\\circ\\sigma_2$ is a homothety with center $O$ and ratio $k_1k_2$, and $O$, $O_1$ and $O_2$ are collinear. If $k_1k_2 = 1$, then $\\sigma_1\\circ\\sigma_2$ is a translation.\n\nThis can be proved via Desargues' theorem. Try it!\n\n[h3]Inversion[/h3]\nAs much as in homothety:\n[ul][li]If two diagrams are inverse then all lines connecting corresponding points are concurrent at the inversion center.[/li]\n  [li]In an inversion, the inversion center and two corresponding points are collinear.[/li][/ul]\n\n[h3]Some final hints[/h3]\n[ul][li]Guessing the common point of concurrent lines or the line passing through collinear points can be really helpful. Another good reason to make good, big diagrams.[/li]\n  [li]Any concurrency problem is a collinearity problem: just prove that the intersection $P$ of two of these lines lies on the other line; if this line is defined by two points $A$ and $B$, then you have to prove that $A$, $B$ and $P$ are collinear.[/li]\n  [li]Good ol' angle chasing is helpful as well![/li][/ul]\n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n[ol]\n  [li](Brazil 2009) [problem]1312[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Iberoamerican 2010) [problem]1313[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Russia 2012) [problem]1314[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1315[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1316[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1317[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Brazil 2006) [problem]1318[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Iberoamerican Shortlist 2010) [problem]1319[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1320[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1321[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1978, generalized) [problem]1322[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1981) [problem]1323[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1982) [problem]1324[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1995) [problem]1325[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1996) [problem]1326[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 1997) [problem]1327[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 1997) [problem]1328[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 2000) [problem]1329[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 2001) [problem]1330[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Iran TST 2002) [problem]1331[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Olympic Revenge 2002) [problem]1332[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 2003) [problem]1333[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 2004) [problem]1334[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Iberoamerican 2004) [problem]1335[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 2006) [problem]1336[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 2007) [problem]1337[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMOSL 2007) [problem]1338[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 2008) [problem]1339[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Sharygin 2008) [problem]1340[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Romanian Master 2009) [problem]1341[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Olympic Revenge 2010) [problem]1342[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Romanian Master 2010) [problem]1343[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Sharygin 2010) [problem]1344[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	76	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:22:26.750922	2015-08-22 00:22:26.750922	\N

111	[b]Definition[/b] [i]The binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ is\ndefined to be[/i] $$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.$$\n\nThe binomial coefficient $\\binom{n}{k}$ can be understood as the\nnumber of subsets of size $k$ of an $n$-element set (in other\nwords, the number of ways to choose $k$ objects from a collection\nof $n$ objects).  By way of convention, if ($k$ is an integer and)\n$k<0$ or $k>n$, $\\binom{n}{k} = 0$.  Since the formula for the\nbinomial coefficient can be written as $$\\binom{n}{k} =\n\\frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\\cdots(n-k+1)}{k!},$$ we may think of the\nbinomial coefficient as a polynomial in $n$, in fact defined for\nall $x$.  The convention for $k>n$ as stated above is consistent\nwith this.\n\n[b]Theorem 1 (The Binomial Theorem).[/b] The following formula\nholds:\n$$(x+y)^n = \\binom{n}{0}x^n + \\binom{n}{1}x^{n-1}y + \\binom{n}{2}\nx^{n-2}y^2 +\\cdots + \\binom{n}{n-1}xy^{n-1}+ \\binom{n}{n} y^n.$$\n\n[i]Proof.[/i] Let us determine the coefficient of $x^ky^{n-k}$.  If\nwe write out the product as $$(x+y)(x+y)(\\cdots)(x+y),$$ we can\nobserve that for each way of choosing $k$ of these multiplicands,\nthere is a contribution of 1 to the coefficient of $x^ky^{n-k}$,\nsince we can think of $x$'s from the chosen multiplicands being\nmultiplied by the $y$'s from those not chosen.  Each contribution\nto the coefficient in question arises uniquely in this way, and so\nwe have identified the two quantities, as we wanted.\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] [i]Let $n$ and $k$ be positive integers with $n\n\\ge k$.

78	Today we expand the toolkit with a handful of practical results.  The first is perhaps the easiest to understand.\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] (Wilson's Theorem) Let $p$ be a prime.  Then \\[(p-1)!\\equiv-1\\bmod p.\\]\n\nWhile simple, the proof is a little sneaky (and typifies smart number theory arguments).  In the same vein, we have the following classical result:\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] (Fermat's Little Theorem) Let $p$ be a prime and $a$ an integer.  Then \\[a^p\\equiv a\\bmod p.\\]  If $p\\not | a$, we may write this equivalently as \\[a^{p-1}\\equiv 1\\bmod p.\\]\n\nWe gave three distinct proofs of this.

Then \\[a^{\\varphi(m)}\\equiv 1\\bmod m,\\] where $\\varphi(m)$, Euler's [i]totient function[/i], denotes the number of residue classes mod $m$ relatively prime to the modulus.\n\nIf the distinct primes dividing $m$ are denoted $p_1,p_2,\\ldots,p_n$, then the following formula holds:\n\n\\[\\varphi(m) = m\\left(1-\\frac 1{p_1}\\right)\\left(1-\\frac 1{p_2}\\right)\\cdots\\left(1-\\frac 1{p_n}\\right).\\]\n\nWe gave two proofs of this.\n\nEuler's theorem revelas that whenever $(a,m)=1$, there exists an exponent $r>0$ such that $a^r\\equiv 1\\bmod m$.  This motivates a definition:\n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] Let $(a,m)=1$.  The [i]order[/i] of $a\\bmod m$ is the smallest positive integer $r$ such that $a^r\\equiv 1\\bmod m.$  We might write $r=\\mathrm{ord}_m(a).$\n\nOrders will be useful.  For example, we have the following easy fact:\n\n[b]Theorem 4.[/b] Suppose $(a,m)=1$, and suppose $a^s\\equiv 1\\bmod m$.  Then $\\mathrm{ord}_m(a) | s$.  As a corollary, we get that \\[\\mathrm{ord}_m(a) | \\varphi(m).\\]\n\nIn other words, orders may only range through factors of $\\varphi(m)$.

81	[b]MOSP 2005, Red[/b]\n\n [b]Inequalities[/b]\n\n First on our list of major tools is the arithmetic\nmean-geometric mean inequality, often abbreviated as "AM-GM."\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] (AM-GM) Let $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ be nonnegative real numbers. Then the\nfollowing inequality holds:\n$$\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i \\geq \\sqrt[n]{x_1x_2\\cdots x_n}.$$\nWe have equality if and only if all the $x_i$ are equal.\n\n The left hand side of the inequality is known as the\narithmetic mean of the $x_i$; the right hand side is known as the\ngeometric mean of the $x_i$.  To prove AM-GM, it is actually\nconvenient to prove a slightly more general result, weighted\nAM-GM.  But first, a lemma:\n\n[b]Lemma 1.[/b] For any $r\\geq 1$, and any $\\lambda$ with $0<\\lambda < 1$, we have\nthat $$\\lambda(r-1)\\geq r^\\lambda - 1,$$ with equality if and only\nif $r=1$.\n\n[b]Proof 1.[/b] We will prove this first for $\\lambda$ rational, say $\\lambda =\na/b$ with $a$ and $b$ positive integers. We wish to prove that\n$$\\frac{a}{b}(r-1)\\geq r^{a/b} - 1.$$  Let $s=r^{1/b}-1$, so that\nwe wish to show that $$\\frac{(1+s)^b - 1}{b}\\geq \\frac{(1+s)^a -\n1}{a}.$$  Using the binomial theorem, this is equivalent to saying\nthat $$\\sum_{k=1}^b \\frac{1}{b}\\binom{b}{k}s^k\\geq\n\\sum_{k=1}^b\\frac{1}{a}\\binom{a}{k}s^k.$$  But since $1\\leq a<b$,\n$$\\frac{1}{b}\\binom{b}{k} = \\frac{1}{k}\\binom{b-1}{k-1} \\geq\n\\frac{1}{k}\\binom{a-1}{k-1} = \\frac{1}{a}\\binom{a}{k}.$$ Notice\nthat this is a strict inequality if $k>1$.  Therefore, our desired\ninequality holds, and we have equality if and only if $s=0$, i.e.\n$r=1$.\n\nTo extend to the case of arbitrary real $\\lambda$, notice that by\nreplacing $r$ with $r^{1/n}$ for some positive integer $n$, the\nabove relation for integers $a<b$\n$$\\frac{r^a - 1}{a}\\leq \\frac{r^b - 1}{b}$$ shows that\n$$\\frac{r^{q_1}-1}{q_1}\\leq \\frac{r^{q_2} - 1}{q_2}$$ for each rational $q_1 < q_2$,\nwith equality if and only if $r=1$.  It follows that\n$(r^\\lambda-1)/\\lambda$ is an increasing function of $\\lambda$ on\n$(0,1)$.  But then if $q$ is a rational with $\\lambda<q<1$, then\n$$\\frac{r^\\lambda - 1}{\\lambda}\\leq \\frac{r^q - 1}{q}\\leq r-1.$$\nIf equality holds, then equality also holds for $q$, and so $r=1$.\n\nNow we prove weighted AM-GM, with Theorem 1 (AM-GM) as a\ncorollary.\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] (Weighted AM-GM) Let $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ be nonnegative\nreal numbers, and $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_n$ positive real\nnumbers (weights) with $\\lambda_1+\\cdots+\\lambda_n = 1$. Then\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n\\lambda_ix_i\\geq\nx_1^{\\lambda_1}x_2^{\\lambda_2}\\cdots x_n^{\\lambda_n},$$ with\nequality if and only if all the $x_i$ are equal.\n\n[b]Proof 2.[/b] We induct on $n$.  For $n=1$ the result holds trivially. For\n$n=2$, the result holds trivially if $x_1$ or $x_2$ is 0.\nOtherwise, suppose $0<x_1\\leq x_2.$  We see that we wish to prove\nthat\n$$\\lambda_1x_1+\\lambda_2x_2\\geq x_1^{\\lambda_1}x_2^{\\lambda_2},$$\nwhich is equivalent to saying that\n$$1-\\lambda_2+\\lambda_2\\frac{x_2}{x_1}\\geq \\left(\\frac{x_2}{x_1}\\right)^{\\lambda_2}.$$\nLetting $r=x_2/x_1\\geq 1$, we see that Lemma 2 gives us this\ninequality, and that equality holds if and only if $r=1$, i.e.\n$x_1=x_2,$ as desired.\n\nNow suppose we have proven the result for $n=m-1\\geq 2$.  We wish\nto prove it for $n=m.$  So suppose we are given nonnegative real\nnumbers $x_1,\\ldots,x_m$ and $\\lambda_1,\\ldots,\\lambda_m$ as in\nthe theorem statement.  Define $\\lambda=\\lambda_m$, and $\\mu =\n1-\\lambda = \\lambda_1+\\cdots+\\lambda_{m-1}.$  Further, put $X=x_m$\nand\n$$Y=\\frac{1}{\\mu}\\left(\\lambda_1x_1+\\cdots+\\lambda_{m-1}x_{m-1}\\right).$$\nWe see that $$\\sum_{i=1}^m\\lambda_ix_i = \\lambda X + \\mu Y \\geq\nX^\\lambda Y^\\mu = x_m^{\\lambda_m}Y^\\mu,$$ by weighted AM-GM for\n$n=2$.  Now, notice that $$Y =\n\\sum_{i=1}^{m-1}\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_i}{\\mu}\\right) x_i\\geq\nx_1^{\\lambda_1/\\mu}x_2^{\\lambda_2/\\mu}\\cdots\nx_{m-1}^{\\lambda_{m-1}/\\mu} = \\left(\nx_1^{\\lambda_1}x_2^{\\lambda_2}\\cdots\nx_{m-1}^{\\lambda_{m-1}}\\right)^{1/\\mu},$$ by weighted AM-GM for\n$n=m-1.$  Putting these two together, we get that\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^m\\lambda_ix_i\\geq\nx_1^{\\lambda_1}x_2^{\\lambda_2}\\cdots x_m^{\\lambda_m}.$$  Finally,\nif we have equality, we must have had equality in all the\ninequalities we used, so all the $x_i$ for $i=1,\\ldots,m-1$ are\nequal, in fact equal to $Y$, and since $x_m = X = Y,$ we are done.\n\nAs you might expect, we refer to the left-hand side of the\nweighted AM-GM inequality as the weighted arithmetic mean of the\n$x_i$ with weights $\\lambda_i$, and the right-hand side as the\nweighted geometric mean of the $x_i$ with weights $\\lambda_i$.\nSetting $\\lambda_i = \\frac{1}{n}$ for all $i$ recovers AM-GM.\n\nIf we apply weighted AM-GM to $1/x_1,\\ldots,1/x_n$, with $x_i>0$,\nthen we can conclude that\n$$\\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\lambda_i}{x_i} \\geq\n\\left(\\frac{1}{x_1}\\right)^{\\lambda_1}\n\\left(\\frac{1}{x_2}\\right)^{\\lambda_2}\\cdots\n\\left(\\frac{1}{x_n}\\right)^{\\lambda_n}.$$  Reciprocating both sides\n(which reverses the order of the inequality), we find that\n$$x_1^{\\lambda_1}x_2^{\\lambda_2}\\cdots x_n^{\\lambda_n}\\geq\n\\left( \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\lambda_i}{x_i} \\right)^{-1},$$ with equality\nif and only if all the $x_i$ are equal. The right-hand side of\nthis is often called the weighted harmonic mean, and so this is\nthe weighted GM-HM inequality. Sometimes this is adjoined to AM-GM\nto produce "weighted AM-GM-HM."\n\n Another inequality which comes in quite handy is the\nCauchy-Schwarz inequality.\n\n[b]Theorem 3.[/b] (Cauchy-Schwarz) Suppose $(x_i)_{i=1}^n$ and $(y_i)_{i=1}^n$\nare two (finite) sequences of reals (possibly negative).  Then\n$$\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right)\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2\\right)\\geq\n\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_iy_i\\right)^2,$$ with equality if and only if the\ntwo sequences are proportional (one consists only of zeroes, or\nthere is a real number $\\lambda$ such that $y_i = \\lambda x_i$ for\nall $i$.\n\n[b]Proof 3.[/b] If one sequence or the other consists only of zeroes, then the\nresult is immediate.  Otherwise, let $t$ be an indeterminate\nvariable.  Define the function $F(t)$ as $$F(t) = \\sum_{i=1}^n\n(x_it - y_i)^2.$$  Because it is a sum of squares, we know that\n$F(t)$ takes only nonnegative values.  Suppose $F(\\lambda)=0$ for\nsome specific $\\lambda.$  Then each of the summands in the\ndefinition of $F$ must be $0$, whence $y_i=\\lambda x_i.$ Therefore\n$F$ has a real zero if and only if $(x_i)$ and $(y_i)$ are\nproportional. Now,\n$$F(t) = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right) t^2 - 2\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n\nx_iy_i\\right) t + \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2,$$ so that $F$ is a quadratic in\n$t$.  Since $F$ takes nonnegative values, we know that this\nquadratic has one or no real roots, with one root if and only if\nthe proportionality condition is satisfied.  But then the\ndiscriminant is nonpositive!  We see that $$4\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n\nx_iy_i\\right)^2 - 4\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right)\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n y_i^2\\right)\n\\leq 0,$$ with equality if and only if the two sequences are\nproportional; this is what we wanted.\n\n Another approach which can come in handy sometimes is using\nfacts about convex functions (if you know calculus, these are just\nfunctions with a nonnegative second derivative, i.e.\n"bowl-shaped" functions). First, we have a\n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] A real-valued function $f$ defined on an interval is said to be\n{\\emph convex} if for every $x,y$ in the interval and every\n$\\lambda\\in(0,1)$, $$f(\\lambda x + (1-\\lambda)y)\\leq \\lambda\nf(x)+(1-\\lambda)f(y).$$  If the inequality is always strict\nwhenever $x\\neq y$, $f$ is called {\\emph strictly convex}.\n\nNotice that it follows from the definition that for any\n$\\lambda_1,\\ldots \\lambda_n\\geq 0$ with\n$\\lambda_1+\\lambda_2+\\ldots+\\lambda_n = 1$, and any $x_1,\\ldots\nx_n$ in the domain of the convex function $f$,\n$$f(\\lambda_1x_1+\\lambda_2x_2+\\cdots+\\lambda_nx_n)\\leq\n\\lambda_1 f(x_1) + \\lambda_2 f(x_2)+\\cdots + \\lambda_n f(x_n);$$\nindeed, this is just an induction analogous to the last step of\nthe proof of weighted AM-GM.  The same argument adapted to this\nmore general situation gives that if $f$ is strictly convex, then\nequality here implies that all the $x_i$ are equal.  Simple as\nthis is to conclude from (a part of) the argument for weighted\nAM-GM, this fact is usually known as Jensen's inequality.\n\n[b]Theorem 4.[/b] (Jensen's Inequality)  If $f$ is a convex function,\n$x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ are reals in the domain of $f$, and\n$\\lambda_1,\\ldots \\lambda_n$ are positive reals with\n$\\lambda_1+\\cdots+\\lambda_n = 1$, then\n$$f(\\lambda_1x_1+\\lambda_2x_2+\\cdots+\\lambda_nx_n)\\leq \\lambda_1\nf(x_1) + \\lambda_2 f(x_2)+\\cdots + \\lambda_n f(x_n);$$ if $f$ is\nstrictly convex, then equality holds if and only if all the $x_i$\nare equal.\n\nSome examples of convex functions you already know include\n\n[ul][li]The "line" $f(x) = ax+b$.  The proof is immediate; this\n  function is not strictly convex.[/li]\n  [li]The functions $f(x)=a^x$ for $a>0$.  This follows from (and in\n  fact is equivalent to) weighted AM-GM.  These functions are\n  strictly convex as long as $a\\neq 1$.[/li]\n  [li]The functions $f(x) = |x|^c$ where $c\\geq 1$.

Lest you wonder why\nwe don't just start with Power Mean, it should be pointed out that\nin many proofs of the Power Mean Inequality, AM-GM-HM is a crucial\nspecial case that must be covered separately.\n\n Now in addition to these basic theorems, it is also helpful\nto have at one's disposal a whole host of techniques for attacking\ninequality problems.

82	Inclusion-Exclusion can be a useful method for counting\nthe union of a collection of prescribed sets.  Suppose we are\ngiven a bunch of finite sets $S_1,S_2,\\ldots, S_n$.  A first\napproximation to the number of elements of $S_1\\cup S_2\\cup\n\\cdots\\cup S_n$ might be $$|S_1\\cup S_2\\cup \\cdots\\cup S_n| =\n|S_1|+ |S_2|+ \\cdots+ |S_n|.$$  This of course does not work in\ngeneral: the $S_i$ might overlap.  So as a second approximation,\nwe might subtract off the sizes of all the pairwise intersections\n$S_i\\cap S_j$, $i\\neq j$.  Now we are undercounting the elements\nwhich occur in three of the sets, so we add those back, etc.\n\nPursuant of a systematic approach to all this, we formulate a\ntheorem.\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion)  Let $S_1,\\ldots, S_n$ be a\ncollection of $n$ finite sets.  Then: $\\begin{equation} |S_1\\cup\nS_2\\cup\\cdots\\cup S_n| = \\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq n} |S_i| - \\sum_{1\\leq\ni < j\\leq n} |S_i \\cap S_j|\\nonumber  + \\sum_{1\\leq i< j < k\\leq\nn} |S_i\\cap S_j\\cap S_k| - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}|S_1\\cap\nS_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap S_n|. \\nonumber\\end{equation}$\n\n[b]Proof 1.[/b] We need to check that each element of the union of the $S_i$ is\ncounted only once on the right-hand side.  Suppose, then, that $x$\nis an element of the union, and let $k\\geq 1$ be the number of\nsets in the collection in which $x$ appears.  The first summation\nwill count $x$ a number of times equal to $k$; once for each set\nin which $x$ appears.  The second sum will count $x$ once for\nevery pair of sets with $x$ appearing in both; there are\n$\\binom{k}{2}$ of those.  Similarly, the third summation counts\n$\\binom{k}{3}$, and the $j^{\\mathrm {th}}$ counts $\\binom{k}{j}$.  Therefore,\nthe total number of times $x$ is counted is \\[\\binom{k}{1} -\n\\binom{k}{2} + \\binom{k}{3} - \\cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\\binom{k}{k} =\n1-(1-1)^k = 1.\\]  Each element is thus counted 1 time on the\nright-hand side, and we are done.\n\nNotice that it follows from the argument that if we sum up to the\n$r^{\\mathrm {th}}$ term of the Inclusion-Exclusion formula, then we will be\nequal to or over the final count if $r$ is odd and equal to or\nunder if $r$ is even.  This follows from the fact that\n\\[\\binom{k}{1}-\\binom{k}{2}+\\binom{k}{3}-\\cdots+(-1)^{r-1}\\binom{k}{r}\n= 1 + (-1)^{r-1}\\binom{k-1}{r}.\\]  These facts (I think) are known\nas \\emph {Bonferonni's Inequalities.}\n\nThe statement of this theorem may look a bit intimidating, but it\nis actually quite simple.  For example, the case $n=3$ gives \\[\n|R\\cup S\\cup T| = |R| + |S| + |T| - |R\\cap S| - |R\\cap T| - |S\\cap\nT| + |R\\cap S\\cap T|.\\]  Putting this into practice, suppose\n$R=\\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$, $S=\\{b,c,e,f\\}$, and $T=\\{a,c,f,g\\}$.  Then we\nconclude that \\[|R\\cup S\\cup T| = 5+4+4 - 3-2-2+1 = 7.\\]\n\nInclusion-Exclusion is often known in the following (equivalent\nbut) different form:\n\n[b]Corollary 1.[/b] Let $S_1\\ldots,S_n$ be subsets of a set $X$, and let $S_i^c$\ndenote the complement of $S_i$ in $X$.  Then $\\begin{equation} |S_1^c\\cap\nS_2^c\\cap\\cdots \\cap S_n^c| = |X| - \\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq n} |S_i| +\n\\sum_{1\\leq i < j\\leq n} |S_i \\cap S_j|\\nonumber  - \\sum_{1\\leq\ni< j < k\\leq n} |S_i\\cap S_j\\cap S_k| + \\cdots + (-1)^n|S_1\\cap\nS_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap S_n|. \\nonumber\\end{equation}$\n\n[b]Proof 2.[/b] This follows from Inclusion-Exclusion upon observing that\n\\[S_1^c\\cap S_2^c\\cap\\cdots \\cap S_n^c = \\left( S_1\\cup S_2\\cup\\cdots\\cup\nS_n\\right)^c.\\]\n\nThis form has a particularly elegant version.  Fix a finite set\n$X$, and for any $\\mathcal C$ a finite (possibly empty) collection\nof subsets of $X$, let $\\bigcap \\mathcal C$ be the intersection of\nall elements of $\\mathcal C$, or $X$ if $\\mathcal C$ is empty.\nThen: \\[\\left|\\bigcap_{S\\in\\mathcal C}S^c\\right| = \\sum_{\\mathcal\nU\\subseteq\\mathcal C} (-1)^{|\\mathcal U|}\\left|\\bigcap\\mathcal\nU\\right|.\\]\n\n Let us look at some examples of inclusion-exclusion in\naction.\n\n [b]Example 1.[/b] Determine the number of primes less or\nequal to 111.\n\n [b]Example 2.[/b][AIME 2001] Each unit square of a\n3-by-3 unit-square grid is to be colored either blue or red.

83	[h2]Some summation techniques[/h2]\n\n[ul][li][b]Telescoping sums:[/b]\n  Suppose we want to evaluate the sum $a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n$, and we can write each $a_i$ as $b_i-b_{i+1}$ for some collection of numbers $b_i$.  Then all the $b_i$'s cancel except for $b_1$ and $b_{n+1}$, and we are left with $b_1-b_{n+1}$.\n\n  For instance, we can evaluate the sum $1+3+5+\\cdots+(2k-1)$ by writing the $i$th odd number as $i^2-(i-1)^2$, obtaining the sum: $$(1^2-0^2)+(2^2-1^2)+(3^2-2^2)+\\cdots+(k^2-(k-1)^2)=k^2-0^2=k^2.$$[/li]\n  [li][b]Induction:[/b] For finite sums, it's often possible to just guess the answer and then prove your guess by induction.[/li]\n  [li][b]Solve for the sum:[/b] Let $S$ be the sum you wish to find, manipulate $S$ in order to simplify the sum, and finally solve for $S$.  For instance, to evaluate the infinite sum $$S=\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty\\frac{j^2}{2^j},$$ we might consider multiplying by $2$ to shift the indices.  We have  $$2(S-1)=\\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\frac{j^2}{2^{j-1}}=\\sum_{j=0}^\\infty \\frac{(j+1)^2}{2^j}$$  Subtracting $S$ from this, we find $2(S-1)-S=\\sum_{j=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{2j+1}{2^{j}}$.  So far, we have reduced the $j^2$ to a $2j+1$ in the numerator.  Can you finish it from here?[/li]\n  [li][b]Generating functions:[/b]  It can be useful to consider the sum as a coefficient in a generating function, especially in the following circumstances:\n  [ul][li][b]Partial sums:[/b] Say we want to find a formula for $1^2+2^2+\\cdots+n^2$.  First consider the generating function $S(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty n^2x^n$.  Now, if we divide by $1-x$, we get the partial sums as the coefficients of the new generating function: $$\\frac{S(x)}{(1-x)}=\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty (1^2+2^2+\\cdots+n^2)x^n.$$  So, we just need to find the coefficient of $x^n$ in $\\frac{S(x)}{(1-x)}$, which equals $\\frac{x^2+x^4}{(1-x)^4}$ (why?).  We expand $(1-x)^{-4}$ using the [i]extended binomial theorem[/i]:\n\n  \\begin{eqnarray*}\n  \\frac{1}{(1-x)^4} &=& \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (-1)^n\\binom{-4}{n}x^n \\\\\n  &=&\\sum (-1)^n\\frac{(-4)(-5)(-6)\\cdots(-4-n+1)}{n!}x^n \\\\\n       &=& \\sum \\frac{4\\cdot 5\\cdot \\cdots\\cdot (n+3)}{n!} x^n \\\\ \n       &=& \\sum \\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}x^n\n  \\end{eqnarray*}\n\n  Multiplying this by $x+x^2$, the coefficient of $n$ in the result is $$\\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{6}+\\frac{n(n+1)(n+2)}{6}=\\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6},$$ as desired.[/li]\n    [li][b]Convolutions:[/b]  Sums of the form $$a_0b_n+a_1b_{n-1}+\\cdots+a_nb_0$$ are called [i]convolutions[/i], and they should alert your generating function radar.

91	[b]Abstract.[/b] The aim of this handout is to provide a mathematically complete treatise on Lagrange Multipliers and how to apply them on optimization problems. The ideas here are presented logically rather than pedagogically, so it may be beneficial to read the examples before the formal statements.\n\nLagrange multipliers offer a way to find the extrema of an [b]objective function[/b] $f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n)$ subject to a [b]constraint function[/b] $g(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) = 0$; for example, we may wish to maximize $a+b+c$ subject to $a^2+b^2+c^2=1$.\n\nHowever, there are lots of tiny details that need to be checked in order to completely solve a problem with Lagrange multipliers.\nOn an olympiad the use of Lagrange multipliers is almost certain to draw the wrath of graders, so it is imperative that all these details are done correctly.\n\n[h2]Analysis Preliminaries[/h2]\nFirst, we need to define several terms. Let $\\mathbb{R}$ denote the set of real numbers, and let $\\mathbb{R}^n$ denote the set of $n$-tuples of real numbers; that is, $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.\n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] A [b]neighborhood[/b] of a point $p \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$ is some set of points of the form\n\t\\[ \\left\\{ x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid d(x,p) < \\epsilon \\right\\} \\]\n\twhere $d(x,y)$ denotes the distance between two points, and $\\epsilon$ is a positive real number.\nIn other words, a neighborhood is just a "sphere" with nonzero radius $\\epsilon$.\nNow, we need to introduce some definitions from real analysis.\n\n[b]Definition 2.[/b] A subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is [b]open[/b] in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ if for every point $p \\in S$, there exists a neighborhood of $p$ completely contained inside $S$.\n\n[Image missing]\n\n[b]Example.[/b] In $\\mathbb{R}^2$, the open disk\n\t\\[ D = \\left\\{ (x,y) \\mid x^2+y^2 < 1 \\right\\} \\]\n\tis open because for every point $p$ inside it, we can find a small neighborhood completely inside the disk.  See \\Cref{fig:example_open}, noting that $D$ does not contain its "boundary".\n\n\tSimilarly, the open interval $(0,1)$ is open in $\\mathbb{R}$.\n\n[b]Definition 3.[/b] A subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is [b]closed[/b] in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ if the following holds: if $x_1$, $x_2$, \\dots, is a sequence of points in $S$ which converges to some limit $x$, then $x \\in S$.\n\t\n\tAn equivalent definition is that $\\mathbb{R}^n \\setminus S$ should be open.\n\n[b]Example 1.[/b] The closed disk $\\overline D = \\left\\{ (x,y) \\mid x^2+y^2 \\le 1 \\right\\}$ is closed. Similarly, the closed interval $[0,1]$ is closed in $\\mathbb{R}$ (meaning: if a convergent sequence of reals is between $0$ and $1$ inclusive, then it must converge to a real number between $0$ and $1$ inclusive).\n\nAnd now you know why open and closed intervals are so called! Note that most sets are neither open nor closed in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and some sets are both open and closed (such as $\\varnothing$, the empty set, as well as the entire $\\mathbb{R}^n$).\n\n[b]Remark 1.[/b] Up to now we have been kosher in saying that a set $S$ is closed [b]in $\\mathbb{R}^n$[/b], this is important because a set is only open or closed relative to its parent. However, we will henceforth drop the clause "in $\\mathbb{R}^n$" for brevity.\n\nTo aid with constructing closed and open sets, we have the following nice statements.\n\n[b]Proposition 1.[/b] Let $S$ and $T$ be sets in $\\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\tIf $S$ and $T$ are both open (resp.\\ closed), then $S \\cup T$ and $S \\cap T$ are also both open (resp.\\ closed).\n\n[b]Proposition 2.[/b] Let $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^m$ and $T \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n\tIf $S$ and $T$ are both open (resp.\\ closed), then $S \\times T$ is open (resp.\\ closed) in $\\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$.\n\nYou may also have noticed by now that open and closed sets seem to differ by a "boundary". We can formalize this with the notion of a closure.\n[b]Definition 4.[/b] Given a set $U$, the [b]closure[/b] of $\\overline U$ is the smallest closed set containing $U$.\nOne can prove that $\\overline U$ is closed. I've cheated here with the notion of "smallest"; one can prove that "smallest by inclusion" works out.\nIn practice, for $\\mathbb{R}^n$ this just means {e.g.} adding in the boundary points back into an open set.\n\nFinally, we need one other notion, called compactness.\n[b]Definition 5.[/b] A subset $S$ of $\\mathbb{R}^n$ is [b]bounded[/b] if it can be contained inside an $n$-sphere of finite radius.\n\tIf it is also closed, we say $S$ is [b]compact[/b].\nThe actual definition of compactness is that given any arbitrary sequence in $S$, we can find a sub-sequence which converges. However, in the special case where $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^n$, these are equivalent.\n\n[b]Example 2.[/b] Consider a rectangular box $B = [0,1] \\times [0,2] \\times [0,3]$ in $\\mathbb{R}^3$. We can see that it is both closed and bounded, so it is compact.\n\n[h2]Lagrange Multipliers[/h2]\nWe can give the statement of the theorem of Lagrange Multipliers. \n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] [Lagrange Multipliers] Let $U$ be an open subset of $\\mathbb{R}^n$, and let $f : U \\to \\mathbb{R}$ and $g : U \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be continuous functions with continuous first derivatives.\n\tDefine the constraint set \n\t\\[ S = \\left\\{ \\mathbf x \\in U \\mid g(\\mathbf x) = c \\right\\} \\]\n\tfor some real number $c$.\n\n\tSuppose $\\mathbf x \\in S$ is a local maximum of $f$, meaning for some neighborhood around $\\mathbf x$ the point $\\mathbf x$ gives the maximal value of all points in $S$.\n\tThen either $\\nabla g(\\mathbf x) = \\mathbf 0$ at this point, or for some real number $\\lambda$,\n\t\\[ \\nabla f(\\mathbf x) = \\lambda \\nabla g(\\mathbf x). \\]\n\n(Note that we only discuss maximums; to find minimums simply consider $-f$.)\n\nThis is fine and well, but it does not tell us anything about the [b]global maximum[/b] of $f$ constrained to $g$.\nIndeed, such a global maximum may not even exist!\nThat means there is still tons of work left to find the maximum value of $f$, if indeed it exists.\n\nThe following two lemmas let us save face.\n\n[b]Lemma 1.[/b] Let $S$ be a compact set and $f : U \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function.\n\tThen $f$ has a [b]global[/b] maximum over $S$ -- there exists a point $\\mathbf x \\in S$ such that $f(\\mathbf x) \\ge f(\\mathbf y)$ for any other point $\\mathbf y \\in S$.\n\n[b]Lemma 2.[/b] If $g : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function, then the set\n\t$C = \\left\\{ \\mathbf x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid g(\\mathbf x) = c \\right\\}$\n\tis a closed set for any real number $c$.\n\nHence, we can escape using the following method.\nLet's take our function $f : U \\to \\mathbb{R}$ with $U$ open, and consider the closure $\\overline U$ of $U$.  \nLet's instead optimize $f : \\overline U \\to \\mathbb{R}^n$, where $\\overline U$ is the closure of $U$. Define\n\\[ C = \\left\\{ \\mathbf x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n \\mid g(\\mathbf x) = c \\right\\}. \\]\nNote that $C$ is closed by our lemma. Also, define\n\\[ S = U \\cap C =\n\t\\left\\{ \\mathbf x \\in U \\mid g(\\mathbf x) = c \\right\\} \\]\nas well as\n\\[ \\overline S = \\overline U \\cap C =\n\t\\left\\{ \\mathbf x \\in \\overline U \\mid g(\\mathbf x) = c \\right\\}. \\]\nAs the notation suggests, $\\overline S$ is the closure of $S$, and in any case is clearly itself closed.\nIf either of $C$ or $\\overline U$ is bounded, then so is $\\overline S$, meaning $S$ is compact!  When that occurs, $f$ achieves a maximum $\\mathbf x \\in \\overline S$ somewhere on the set $C \\cap \\overline U$.\n\nWe can then consider two cases.\n[ul][li]If $\\mathbf x \\in \\overline U - U$, that is, $\\mathbf x$ lies in the "boundary", then we can check this case manually.[/li]\n  [li]If $\\mathbf x \\in U$, that is, $\\mathbf x$ lies in the "interior", then we can use Lagrange multipliers. After all, $\\mathbf x$ is a global maximum, so it is certainly a local one as well. Here the constraint set is simply $S = C \\cap U$.[/li][/ul]\n\nThis is the method of Lagrange multipliers.\n\n[h2]Examples[/h2]\n[h3]An Easy Example[/h3]\n\n[b]Example 3.[/b] [AM-GM] For positive reals $a$, $b$, $c$, prove that \n\t\\[ a+b+c \\ge 3\\sqrt[3]{abc}. \\]\n\n[b]Proof 1.[/b] (Solution) The first step is de-homogenizing the inequality to assume that $a+b+c=3$, in which case we wish to prove $abc \\le 1$.

Hence, we focus on the right side.\n\tWe use Lagrange Multipliers.\n\n\tDefine \\[ U = \\left\\{ (a,b,c) \\mid a,b,c > 0 \\text{ and } a^2+b^2+c^2 < 1000 \\right\\}. \\]\n\tThis is an intersection of open sets, so it is open.

Excellent.\n\n\tDefine\n\t\\[ f(a,b,c) = a^2+b^2+c^2+ab+bc+ca. \\]\n\tIt's equivalent to show that $f \\le 6$ subject to $g$. Over $\\overline S$, it must achieve a global maximum.  Now we consider two cases.\n\n\tIf $\\mathbf x$ lies on the boundary, that means one of the components is zero (since $a^2+b^2+c^2=1000$ is clearly impossible). WLOG $c=0$, then we wish to show $a^2+b^2+ab \\le 6$ for $a^2+b^2=4$, which is trivial.\n\n\tNow for the interior $U$, we may use the method of Lagrange Multipliers. Consider a local maximum $\\mathbf x \\in U$.\n\tCompute\n\t\\[ \\nabla f = \\left<2a+b+c, 2b+c+a, 2c+a+b \\right> \\]\n\tand\n\t\\[ \\nabla g = \\left<2a+bc, 2b+ca, 2c+ab\\right>. \\]\n\tOf course, $\\nabla g \\neq \\mathbf 0$ everywhere, so introducing our multiplier yields\n\t\\[ \\left<2a+b+c,a+2b+c,a+b+2c\\right> = \\lambda \\left<2a+bc,2b+ca,2c+ab\\right>. \\]\n\tNote that $\\lambda \\neq 0$ since $a,b,c > 0$.\n\tSubtracting $2a+b+c = \\lambda(2a+bc)$ from $a+2b+c = \\lambda(2b+ca)$ implies that\n\t\\[ (a-b)(\\left[ 2\\lambda - 1 \\right] - \\lambda c) = 0. \\]\n\tWe can derive similar equations for the others.  \n\tHence, we have three cases.\n\n\t[i]Case 1:[/i] If $a=b=c$, then $a=b=c=1$, and this satisfies $f(1,1,1) \\le 6$.\n\n\t[i]Case 2:[/i] If $a$, $b$, $c$ are pairwise distinct, then we derive $a = b = c = 2 - \\lambda^{-1}$, contradiction.\n\n\t[i]Case 3:[/i] Now suppose that $a=b \\neq c$. That means $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2-c}$ (of course our conditions force $c < 2$).  Now\n\t\\[ 2a+2c = a+b+2c = \\lambda (2c+ab)\n\t\t= \\frac{1}{2-c} (2c+a^2) \\]\n\twhich implies\n\t\\[ 4a+4c-2a^2-2ac = 2c+a^2 \\]\n\tmeaning (with the additional note that $a \\neq 1$) we have\n\t\\[ c = \\frac{3a^2-4a}{2-2a}. \\]\n\tNote that at this point, $c > 0$ forces $1 < a < \\frac 43$.\n\n\tThe constraint $a^2+b^2+c^2+abc=4 \\iff c^2 + + a^2c + (2a^2-4) = 0$ now gives\n\t\\[ \\left( 3a^2-4a \\right)^2\n\t\t+ a^2 \\left( 3a^2-4a \\right)\\left( 2-2a \\right)\n\t\t+ \\left( 2a^2-4 \\right)\\left( 2-2a \\right)^2 = 0. \\]\n\tBefore expanding this, it is prudent to see if it has any rational roots. A quick inspection finds that $a=2$ is such a root (precisely, $16-32+16=0$).\n\tNow, we can expand and try to factor:\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t0 &= -6a^5 + 31a^4 - 48a^3 + 8a^2 + 32a - 16 \\\\\n\t\t&= (a-2)(-6a^4 + 19a^3 - 10a^2 - 12a + 8) \\\\\n\t\t&= (a-2)^2 \\left( -6a^3+7a^2+4a-4 \\right) \\\\\n\t\t&= (a-2)^2 (2-3a)(2a^2-a-2).\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tThe only root $a$ in the interval $\\left( 1,\\tfrac43 \\right)$ is $a = \\frac 14 \\left( 1 + \\sqrt{17} \\right)$. You can guess what comes next -- write\n\t\\[ c = \\frac{a(3a-4)}{2-2a} = \\frac{1}{8} \\left( 7 - \\sqrt{17} \\right) \\]\n\tand\n\t\\[ f(a,b,c)\n\t\t= 3a^2+2ac+c^2\n\t\t= \\frac{1}{32} \\left( 121 + 17\\sqrt{17} \\right)\n\t\t. \\]\n\tThis is the last critical point, so we're done once we check this is less than $6$.  This follows from the inequality $17^3 < (6 \\cdot 32 - 121)^2$; in fact, we actually have\n\t\\[ \\frac{1}{32} \\left( 121 + 17\\sqrt{17}  \\right)\n\t\t\\approx 5.97165. \\]\n\tThis completes the solution.\n\n\n[h3]A Non-Example[/h3]\nThe following is not actually an example because you get stuck at the end (and it turns out you [i]must[/i] get stuck, as I explain), but I included it because of popular request.\n\n[b]Example 5.[/b] [USAMO 2014/1] Let $w$, $x$, $y$, $z$ be real numbers satisfying\n\t\\[ wx+xy+yz+zx+wy+xz \\ge 5 + wxyz. \\]\n\tProve that\n\t\\[ (w^2+1)(x^2+1)(y^2+1)(z^2+1) \\ge 16. \\]\n\n[b]Proof 3.[/b] (Non-Solution) By scaling appropriately, we can assume our condition is actually an equality. Moreover, we will only prove the inequality in the case where\n\t\\[ w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2 \\le 1000 \\]\n\tsince the conclusion is obvious otherwise.\n\n\tDefine\n\t\\[ f(w,x,y,z) = \\sum_{\\text{cyc}} \\ln (w^2+1) \\]\n\tand\n\t\\[ g(w,x,y,z) = wx+xy+yz+zx+wy+xz-wxyz-5 \\]\n\twhere we have\n\t\\[ U = \\left\\{ (w,x,y,z) \\mid w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2 < 1000 \\right\\} \\]\n\tan open ball, whence\n\t\\[ \\overline U = \\left\\{ (w,x,y,z) \\mid w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2 \\le 1000 \\right\\} \\]\n\tis a closed ball, which is compact.\n\t\n\tFirst, we need to check that $\\nabla g \\neq \\mathbf 0$. Compute\n\t\\[ \\frac{\\partial g}{\\partial w} = x+y+z - xyz. \\]\n\tIf it is the case that all of these are zero, we will derive a contradiction. This would imply that $wx+wy+wz = wxyz$.\n\tCyclically adding we get $2(5+wxyz) = 4wxyz$, whence $wxyz = 5$.\n\tThat means $w(x+y+z) = 5$\n\tso each of $w$, $x$, $y$, $z$ are the nonzero roots of the quadratic $t^2-(w+x+y+z)t+5 = 0$, and so they take on at most two distinct values.\n\tNow we consider a few cases. If $w=x=y=z$ then from $w(x+y+z) = 5$ we must have them all equal to $\\pm \\sqrt{5/3}$, contradicting $wxyz=5$.\n\tIf $x=y=z$ but $w \\neq x$, then $w+x=w+x+y+z \\implies y+z = 0$, so $y=z=0$ which is impossible.\n\tFinally, if $w=x$ and $y=z$ but $w \\neq y$ then $w+y=2(w+y)$, whence $w=-y$. Now we can derive $5=w(x+y+z)=-w^2$, which is impossible.\n\tSo, $\\nabla g \\neq \\mathbf 0$ everywhere.\n\t\n\tNow, the extrema on the boundary of $\\overline U$ trivially satisfy the inequality, so we only need consider the interior.  Evidently we have a $\\lambda$ with\n\t\\[ \\frac{2w}{w^2+1} = \\lambda (x+y+z-xyz). \\]\n\tIf $\\lambda = 0$ then $w=x=y=z=0$, which contradicts the given.\n\tOtherwise, $\\lambda \\neq 0$ whence $wxyz \\neq 0$. \n\tIf we let $s = w+x+y+z$ and $d = wxy+xyz+yzx+zxw$ then we can rearrange this as\n\t\\begin{align*}\n\t\t\\frac{2}{\\lambda} &= \\left( \\frac 1w+w \\right)(x+y+z-xyz) \\\\\n\t\t&= \\frac{w+x+y+z-xyz}{w}-1 + w(x+y+z) - wxyz \\\\\n\t\t&= \\frac{s}{w} - 1 + 5-(xy+yz+zx) \\\\\n\t\t\\frac{2}{\\lambda}-4 &= \\frac{s - (wxy+wyz+wzx+xyz)}{w} = \\frac{s-d}{w}.\n\t\\end{align*}\n\tHence we have two cases. Either $\\lambda = \\frac{1}{2}$ and $s = d$, or \n\t\\[ w = x = y = z = \\frac{s-d}{2/\\lambda - 4} \\]\n\tIn the latter case, we obtain $6w^2 = w^4+5$, which implies that the constant values are one of $\\pm 1$, $\\pm \\sqrt{5}$. Check that none of these cases give $f(w,x,y,z) < 16$.\n\n\tOtherwise, we derive that \n\t\\[ w+x+y+z = wxy+xyz+yzw+zwx \\tag{1}\\]\n\tAt this point we have used all the constraints. That means Lagrange Multipliers is telling us that any point $(w,x,y,z)$ which also satisfies (1) is possibly a local extrema; in other words, one can check that any $\\mathbf x$ satisfying (1) and $wx+xy+yz+zx+wy+xz = 5+wxyz$ also satisfies $\\nabla f(\\mathbf x) = \\lambda \\nabla g(\\mathbf x)$.\n\t\n\tUnfortunately, you can't go farther than this because it turns out that (1) is precisely the equality condition of the original problem.\n\tBoo.

92	[h2]Warmup[/h2]\n\n[b]Problem 1.[/b] [problem]1568[/problem]\n\n[h2]How to Use Complex Numbers[/h2]\n\nIn this handout, we will identify the two dimensional real plane with the one dimensional complex plane.  To each point in vector form, we associate the corresponding complex number.  \n\n[b]Note 1.[/b] Throughout this handout, we use a lowercase letter to denote the complex number that represents the point labeled by the corresponding uppercase letter.\n\nThis allows us to compute geometric transformations easily.  Sometimes, this can lead to solutions that are quite elegant:\n\n[b]Problem 2.[/b] (TST 2006/6) [problem]1569[/problem]\n\nWhen synthetic approaches have failed, we can use computation with complex numbers:\n\n[b]Problem 3.[/b] (MOP 2010) [problem]1570[/problem]\n\n[b]Problem 4.[/b] (USAMO 2012) [problem]1571[/problem]\n\nThere are a number of general principles for this:\n[ul][li]To solve a problem using complex numbers, the general approach is reduce the desired statement to a calculation.  This can be done in a number of ways: \n[ol][/li]\n  [li]Checking a condition (for parallel lines, cyclic quadrilaterals, collinearity) or checking a claim about angles or distances given in the problem.  In this case, you should just calculate and then check the condition.[/li]\n  [li]Reducing the claim to the fact that some two points are the same.  This is usually used to show concurrency or collinearity.  The calculation can sometimes be reduced a bit in this case; if the problem involves a triangle $ABC$ and asks to show that some lines $\\ell_A, \\ell_B, \\ell_C$ defined symmetrically in terms of $A, B, C$ are concurrent, then it is enough to show that the coordinates of $\\ell_A \\cap \\ell_B$ are symmetric in $a, b, c$.[/li]\n[/ol]\n[li]Before checking any conditions, it is important to set up a good set of variable points to compute with.  Some pointers:\n[ol][/li]\n  [li]If there is a circle that figures prominently in the problem, you should set this to be the unit circle so that conjugates of points are also explicitly computable.  In particular, if a triangle or quadrilateral is circumscribed rather than inscribed, take the points of tangency as your variables.[/li]\n  [li]Any synthetic observations you make (most commonly, finding a spiral similarity) might allow you to reduce the number of unknown variables.[/li]\n[/ol]\n[li]Sometimes, solutions will involve a fair amount of algebraic manipulation.  It might seem obvious, but you try to keep the algebra as clean as possible. I recommend the following: (1) Whenever possible, factor. (2) Keep your terms homogeneous so you can spot errors easily. (3) Before you begin, try to estimate the number of terms you will end up with, and prepare accordingly.  Everyone has a personal system for dealing with large expressions; you should find what works for you.[/li][/ul]\n\n[h2]When to Use Complex Numbers[/h2]\n\nThere are a number of signs that suggest a problem can be approached using complex numbers:\n[ul][li]There is one primary circle in the diagram.  If this is the case, you can set this to be the unit circle, and calculate all other points in terms of some values on the circle.  In particular, the common formulas will not contain conjugates, allowing for simpler manipulations.[/li]\n  [li]A small number of points is sufficient to define the diagram. In particular, if the coordinates of each point in the diagram may be computed easily, then solving the problem with complex numbers should be simple.  This most often occurs with a cyclic complete quadrilateral.[/li][/ul]\n\nPerhaps more important is when [b]NOT[/b] to use complex numbers. Do not use complex numbers if:\n[ul][li]You have just started working on a problem.  Complex numbers should only be a method of last resort, and you should almost always try synthetic approaches first.  Regardless of what type of approach you are trying, it is almost always essential that you make some synthetic observations before plunging into calculation.[/li]\n  [li]The problem involves a large number of circles.  The condition for cyclic points is rarely very useful as a given, so the extra circle information will be quite difficult to use.[/li]\n  [li]There are ``too many'' steps in the calculation.  Each additional layer of construction will add to the number of terms that you need to deal with, and at some point, it will become impossible handle.  After using this method a couple times, you will gradually see what your limit is.  Before using complex numbers, make sure the number of terms will not exceed this![/li][/ul]\n\n[h2]Useful Facts[/h2]\n\nBelow are some useful facts.

94	Today, we focus on a key technique in solving combinatorial\nproblems.\n\n"In order to count the elements of a certain set, we replace them with\n  those of another set that has the same number of elements and whose\n  elements are more easily counted."\n\nThe following theorem is rather intuitive, but we will use it\n(implicitly) throughout.\n\n [b]Theorem 1.[/b] [i]Let $A$ and $B$ be finite sets,\nand let $f$ be a function from $A$ to $B$. If $f$ is injective,\nthen there are at least as many elements in $B$ as in $A$.  If $f$\nis surjective, then there are at least as many elements in $A$ as\nin $B$.  Thus, if $f$ is bijective, then $A$ and $B$ have the same\nnumber of elements.[/i]\n\nThe remainder of today will be consumed with examples of problem\nsolutions using this approach (as well, sometimes, as others).\n\n [b]Example 1.[/b] Let $n$ be a positive integer. In how\nmany ways can one write a sum of (at least two) positive integers\nthat add up to $n$? Consider the same set of integers written in a\ndifferent order as being different.

96	We will consider the notion of [i]arithmetic function[/i].\n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] An [i]arithmetic function[/i] is a function $f:\\mathbb N \\rightarrow \\mathbb C$.  In other words, it takes as input any positive integer, and has as output any complex number.  We say that an arithmetic function $f(n)$ is [i]multiplicative[/i] if  [ol][li]$f(1)=1$;[/li]\n    [li]Whenever $(m,n)=1$, $f(mn)=f(m)f(n)$.[/li][/ol]  If the second condition holds without the assumption of relative primality, we say that $f(n)$ is [i]strictly multiplicative[/i].\n\nWe have already seen a good example of a strictly multiplicative arithmetic function, namely the Legendre symbol with respect to a fixed prime $p$.  There are of course many simpler examples.  A few are listed below:\n\n[ul][li]The function $I(n)=n$ which takes every positive integer to itself.[/li]\n  [li]The function $u(n) = 1$, which takes every positive integer to 1.[/li]\n  [li]More generally, for a complex number $s$, the function $e_s(n) = n^s$, which raises $n$ to the $s$th power, so that $I = e_1$ and $u= e_0$.[/li]\n  [li]The function $|n|_p = \\frac 1{p^r}$, where $p^r || n$.  This is the so-called $p$-adic norm, and arises naturally in the discussion of $p$-adic numbers.[/li]\n  [li]The function $\\iota(n)$, defined to be 1 if $n=1$ and 0 otherwise.  You might think of this as $e_{-\\infty}$.[/li][/ul]\n\nIf we weaken our demands to only multiplicative functions, then our examples become much more interesting:\n\n[ul][li]The function $\\tau(n)$ which counts the number of divisors of $n$.[/li]\n  [li]The totient function $\\varphi(n)$, which counts the number of positive integers less than or equal to $n$ which are relatively prime to $n$.[/li]\n  [li]The function $\\sigma(n)$ which denotes the sum of all divisors of $n$.[/li][/ul]\n\nWe will prove that these are multiplicative all at once, even though we could easily do so for each function individually.  Our course of action will be to use the following notion, variants of which show up all across mathematics:\n\n[b]Definition 2.[/b] Suppose $f$ and $g$ are two arithmetic functions.  We define their [i]convolution[/i] $f*g$ as the following: \\[(f*g)(n) = \\sum_{d | n} f(d)g(\\frac nd).\\]\n\nThis definition may seem to come out of nowhere; however it places the above discussion into a new context, as explored in the exercises.\n\nWe will want a few simple properties:\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] The following properties are enjoyed by convolution:\n[ol]\n  [li]If $f,g$ are arithmetic functions, then $f*g = g*f$.[/li]\n  [li]If $f,g,h$ are arithmetic functions, then $(f*g)*h = f*(g*h)$.[/li]\n  [li]If $f$ is an arithmetic function, then $f*\\iota = f$.[/li]\n  [li]If $f$ and $g$ are multiplicative, then so is $f*g$ (this is NOT true in the strictly multiplicative case!)[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nIn other words, convolution gives the set of arithmetic functions a kind of addition with identity (what is known as a [i]monoid law[/i]), and the set of multiplicative functions is closed under this new operation.\n\nWe introduce a new multiplicative function:\n\n[b]Definition 3.[/b] The Mobius function $\\mu$ is defined as follows:\\[\\mu(n) = \\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc} 1 & \\textrm{if }n=1  (-1)^k & \\textrm{if }n\\textrm{ is squarefree and the product of }k\\textrm{ distinct primes}  0 & \\textrm{otherwise.}\\end{array}\\right.\\]\n\nWe see immediately that $\\mu(n)$ is a multiplicative function.  In fact, we have the following neat result:\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] (M\\"obius Inversion Formula) Let $f(n)$ be an arithmetic function, and let $F(n)$ be defined like so:\n\\[F(n) = \\sum_{d | n} f(d).\\]  Then we may recover $f(n)$ from $F(n)$ in the following way: \\[f(n) = (F*\\mu)(n) = \\sum_{d|n} F(d)\\mu(\\frac nd).\\]\n\nIn the exercises we explore some things we may use this for.\n\n\n\n[h3]Problems[/h3]\n\n[ol]\n  \n  [li][problem]1640[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1641[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1642[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1643[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1644[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1645[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1646[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1647[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1648[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1649[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1650[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1651[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1652[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1653[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1654[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1655[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1656[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	96	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:22:56.839818	2015-08-22 00:22:56.839818	\N

98	[b]Abstract.[/b] One important skill in Math is finding patterns. This also applies to Geometry: there are some really cool diagrams that have tons of nice properties. I'll talk about some of my favorites.\n\n[h2]The ubiquitous in(ex)center lemma[/h2]\nThere is another characterization of the incenter and the excenter of a triangle that can be useful in at least two situations:\n[ul][li]you need to prove that some point is the incenter or excenter of a triangle;[/li]\n  [li]you need some isosceles triangles or collinear points.[/li][/ul]\n\n[b]Fact 1.[/b] (The ubiquitous in(ex)center property) Let $I$ be the incenter and $I_a$ be the $A$-excenter of a triangle $ABC$ and $L$ be the midpoint of the arc $BC$ from the circumcircle of $ABC$ that doesn't contain $A$. Then there is a circle with center in $L$ that passes through $B$, $C$, $I$ and $I_a$. Notice that this means that $LB = LC = LI = LI_a$ and, moreover, $L$ is the midpoint of $II_a$.\n\n[Image missing]\n\nThere are a number of ways of interpreting this fact:\n[ol]\n  [li]$L$ is the circumcenter of the quadrilateral $BICI_a$;[/li]\n  [li]You can find the incenter and $A$-excenter of a triangle by marking $L$ and drawing a circle with center in $L$ and radius $LB = LC$. The incenter is the intersection of said circle and angle bisector $AL$. This is particularly useful when you need to prove that $I$ is the incenter or $I_a$ is the $A$-excenter: you don't have to prove that it's the intersection of two bisectors.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h2]Two circles and a tangent line[/h2]\n[b]Fact 2.[/b] (Two circles and a tangent line) Let $\\Omega$ and $\\omega$ be two circles internally tangent at $T$. Chord $AB$ from $\\Omega$ touches $\\omega$ at $P$. Line $PT$ meet $\\Omega$ at $L\\neq T$.\n\n[Image missing]\n\n[ol]\n  [li]Point $L$ is the midpoint of the arc $AB$ that does not contain $T$.[/li]\n  [li]The inversion with center $L$ and radius $LA$ fixes the diagram (it actually takes $AB$ to $\\Omega$ and vice-versa).[/li]\n  [li]$LP\\cdot LT = LA^2$.[/li]\n  [li]$L$ has the same power with respect to all circles $\\omega$ that are tangent to both chord $AB$ and $\\Omega$. Rephrasing: the radical axes of all pairs of such circles $\\omega$ pass through $L$.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h2]Symmedians[/h2]\nThe [i]symmedians[/i] of a triangle $ABC$ are the reflections of the medians with respect to the corresponding internal bisectors. They have some incredible properties.\n\n[b]Fact 3.[/b] (Symmedian facts) Symmedians have [i]tons[/i] of properties. Here are only some of them.\n[ol]\n  [li][i](Finding the symmedian)[/i] Let $\\Gamma$ be the circumcircle of $ABC$; the tangent lines at $B$ and $C$ meet at $D$; then $AD$ is the symmedian.  \n  [Image missing][/li]\n  [li][i](Symmedian ratios)[/i] Let $P$ be any point in the $A$-symmedian. Then the ratio between the distances from $P$ to $AB$ and $AC$ is $\\frac{AB}{AC}$. Also, the $A$-symmedian divides side $BC$ in the ratio $\\frac{AB^2}{AC^2}$.[/li]\n  [li][i](A similarity)[/i] Let the circumcircle of $BCD$ meet line $AD$ again at $K$. Then $ABK$ and $CAK$ are (spirally) similar.[/li]\n  [li][i](Symmedians in cyclic quads)[/i] Let $ABCD$ be a cyclic quadrilateral. Then $AB\\cdot CD = AD\\cdot BC$ iff $AC$ is a symmedian of both $ABD$ and $BCD$ and $BD$ is a symmedian of both $ABC$ and $ADC$.[/li]\n  [li][i](Symmedian and bisectors)[/i] Let line $AD$ meet $BC$ at $T$ and the circumcircle at $L\\neq A$ and let $M$ be the midpoint of $BC$. Then lines $BC$ and $MD$ are the internal and external bisectors of $\\angle LMA$.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h2]Complete quadrilaterals[/h2]\nA [i]complete[/i] quadrilateral is the union of four non-parallel lines. They determine $\\binom42 = 6$ points, which are the vertices of this complete quadrilateral (weird, huh?). Nevertheless, this configuration is pretty cool.\n\n[b]Fact 4.[/b] (Complete quadrilateral facts) Here's what you get if you complete the quadrilateral:\n\n[Image missing]\n\nNow let's see what this complex diagram has to offer:\n[ol]\n  [li][i](Miquel's theorem)[/i] The circumcircles of the $\\binom43 = 4$ triangles determined by the four lines have a common point, named [i]Miquel point[/i] of the complete quadrilateral.[/li]\n  [li][i](Spiral similarity and Miquel's theorem)[/i] The Miquel point is the center of several spiral similarities that take two of the six points to another two of the six points. Eg (refer to the diagram above), $EC\\to AF$, $EA\\to CF$, $AB\\to DC$, $AD\\to BC$.[/li]\n  [li][i](Midpoints in a Gauss line)[/i] The six points of a complete quadrilateral determine three diagonals (segments that are not contained in any of the four original lines). The midpoints of these lines are collinear (the line passing through these points is called the [i]Gauss line[/i] of the complete quadrilateral.[/li]\n  [li][i](More points in a circle, not pictured)[/i] The circumcircles of the four triangles determined by the four lines and the Miquel point lie on a circle.[/li]\n  [li][i](Projecting the Miquel point)[/i] The orthogonal projections of the Miquel point onto the four lines are collinear. Moreover, the line passing through the four projections is perpendicular to the Gauss line.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nIf, in addition, you have a cyclic quad, some additional magic happens!\n\n[b]Fact 5.[/b] (Complete cyclic quad facts) Here's what you get if you complete a cyclic quad:\n\n[Image missing]\n\nRefer to the previous diagram, where $ABCD$ is cyclic. Let $E$ and $F$ be the intersection points of the opposite sides of $ABCD$.\n[ol]\n  [li][i](Cool power of a point)[/i] The sum of the powers of $E$ and $F$ with respect to the circumcircle of $ABCD$ is $EF^2$.[/li]\n  [li][i](Miquel point in a cyclic quad)[/i] The Miquel point of the complete quadrilateral gerenated by $ABCD$ lies on $EF$. In fact, the Miquel point lies on $EF$ iff the quadrilateral $ABCD$ is cyclic.[/li]\n  [li][i](Perpendicular lines)[/i] Let $O$ be the circumcircle of $ABCD$.

99	[h2]Bijections, surjections, injections...[/h2]\n\n Many combinatorial problems can be solved by finding the right bijection.  \n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] A [i]bijection[/i], or [i]bijective map[/i], is a mapping between the elements of two sets $A$ and $B$, in such a way that each element $x$ of $A$ maps to a unique element $z$ of $B$, and vice versa.\n\n Alternatively, a bijection is a function that is both:\n  [ul][li][i]Injective[/i], or [i]one-to-one[/i], which means that if $x$ and $y$ both map to $z$ then $x=y$, and[/li]\n    [li][i]Surjective[/i], or [i]onto[/i], meaning that every element $z$ of $B$ is mapped to by some $x$ in $A$.[/li][/ul]\n\n[h2]Useful properties[/h2]\n\nHere are [b]three very important facts[/b] to remember about bijections:\n [ol]\n  [li]If there is a bijection between finite sets $A$ and $B$, then $A$ and $B$ have the same number of elements.[/li]\n  [li]If $f:A\\to B$ has an inverse $g:B\\to A$, that is, $f(g(b))=b$ and $g(f(a))=a$ for all $a\\in A$ and $b\\in B$, then $f$ is a bijection.[/li]\n  [li]"Bijection between" is an [i]equivalence relation:[/i]\n    [ul][li](Reflexive.) For any set $A$, there is a bijection from $A$ to $A$ (namely, the identity map).[/li]\n    [li](Symmetric.) If there is a bijection $f:A\\to B$, then there is a bijection $g=f^{-1}:B\\to A$.[/li]\n    [li](Transitive.) If there is a bijection $f:A\\to B$, and a bijection $g:B\\to C$, then the composite map $g\\circ f:A\\to C$ is a bijection from $A$ to $C$.[/li][/ul][/li]\n[/ol]\n\nWe can use these principles to help us count the elements of a set: if we wish to find $|A|$ (the number of elements in $A$) and there is a bijection from $A$ to a set $B$ whose elements are easy to count, then we can compute $|B|$ instead since $|A|=|B|$.\n\n  We can also prove two integers $n$ and $m$ are equal by showing they are the number of elements in a pair of sets $A$ and $B$ having a bijection between them.\n\n[b]Example 1.[/b] Prove that $$\\sum_{k=0}^n k\\binom{n}{k}=n2^{n-1}.$$\n\nThere are many ways of going about proving this.  One way is to find a set $A$ that the left hand side counts, and a set $B$ that the right hand side counts, and find a bijection between $A$ and $B$.  This method is sometimes called [i]counting in two ways[/i].\n\nThe left hand side is the number of ways we can choose a subset of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ having any size $k$, and then choosing one of those $k$ to be special.  Thus, the left hand side is the cardinality of the set $$A=\\{(S,e): S\\subseteq\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}, e\\in S\\}.$$  On the other hand, the right hand side is the number of ways of choosing an element $b\\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ (there are $n$ ways to do this) and then choosing a subset $T$ of the remaining numbers.  Thus, the right hand side is the cardinality of $$B=\\{(a,T):1\\le a\\le n, T\\subseteq \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}\\setminus \\{a\\}\\}.$$  Finally, there is a bijection between $A$ and $B$: define $f:A\\to B$ by $f(S,e)=(e,S\\setminus\\{e\\})$.  It has an inverse $g(a,T)=(T\\cup \\{a\\},a)$, and so $f$ is a bijection.\n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n\n[ol]\n\n  [li](b) [problem]1693[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1694[/problem][/li]\n  [li](b) [problem]1695[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1696[/problem][/li]\n  [li](AHSME 1992.)

105	Suppose $(a_n)_{n=0}^\\infty$ is a sequence of (complex) numbers.\nWe may form the following (formal) power series: \\[F(x) =\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n.\\]  This is called the [i]generating\nfunction[/i] of the sequence $(a_n)$.\n\nGenerating functions can be a very useful tool for moving between\ncombinatorics and algebra; they often stand in as closed-form\nobjects which represent the result of a recursion, even if that\nrecursion doesn't have a closed-form term-by-term solution.  One\nvalue of generating functions is that they may be added,\nsubtracted, multiplied, and divided (under easy-to-check\nhypotheses); one may raise a positive number to the power of a\ngenerating function, or compose any generating function with\nanother (again, under suitable hypotheses).\n\nOne function which will come up a lot is the following geometric\nseries: \\[a+arx+ar^2x^2+\\cdots = \\frac{a}{1-rx}.\\]  The expression\non the right is how we will want to think of this generating\nfunction (manipulations of this sort are what make generating\nfunctions useful).  The way you may have learned to understand the\nabove equation, however, is in terms of convergent power series on\nan interval of the real line.  This will [i]not[/i] turn out to be\nvery useful for us, at least initially.  In general we want to\nlook at sequences that might not give rise to actual functions\n(like say $a_n = n^n$).  On the other hand, expressions which make\nsense in the world of functions do not necessarily make sense in\nthe world of generating functions.  For example, consider\n$f(x)=1/(1-x)$ as above and $g(x) = 2+x.$  The composition\n$f(g(x))$ (considered purely generatingfunctionologically) would\ntake the form\n\\[1+(2+x)+(2+x)^2+(2+x)^3+\\cdots = (1+2+2^2+\\cdots)+(1+2\\cdot 2+3\\cdot 2^2+\\cdots)x+\n(1+3\\cdot 2+6\\cdot 2^2+\\cdots)x^2 +\\cdots,\\] i.e. nonsense, even\nthough the composition function\n\\[\\frac{1}{1-(2+x)}=-\\frac{1}{1+x} = -1+x-x^2+x^3-\\cdots\\] is\nperfectly sensible as a generating function.\n\nSince these "functions" we have defined are not really\nfunctions, just formal objects, we should define addition and\nmultiplication before we proceed.\n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] Suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are two generating functions for\nsequences $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ respectively.  Then: [ol] [li]$f(x)+g(x) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (a_n+b_n)x^n$[/li]\n  [li]$f(x)g(x)\n  = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty (a_nb_0+ a_{n-1}b_1+\\cdots + a_0b_n)x^n,$[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nEven though this is an abstract definition, these are certainly\nthe formulas one would obtain if $f$ and $g$ were polynomials.\nIndeed, if you add two polynomials together, the coefficients add\nterm-by-term, and if you multiply two polynomials together, then\nthe coefficient of $x^n$ will be the sum over $k$ of the\ncoefficient of $x^k$ in the first times the coefficient of\n$x^{n-k}$ in the second; such are the ways to obtain $x^n$ in the\nproduct.\n\nOur first theorem will be establish some basic facts about the\narithmetic of generating functions.\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] The following are facts about the arithmetic of generating\nfunctions:\n\n[ol]\n  \n  [li]Addition and multiplication are commutative and\n  associative, the constant functions $0$ and $1$ are additive and\n  multiplicative identities, respectively, and every generating\n  function has an additive inverse.[/li]\n  [li]A generating function has a multiplicative inverse if\n  and only if its constant term (the coefficient of $x^0$) is\n  nonzero.[/li]\n  [li]If $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are generating functions with\n  $f(x)g(x)=0$, then $f(x)=0$ or $g(x)=0$.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[b]Proof 1.[/b] [ol] [li]Since the rules for addition and multiplication were\n  derived from the rules for polynomials, the statements of\n  commutativity and associativity follow from the corresponding\n  statements for polynomials.  For example, given three generating\n  functions $f(x)$, $g(x)$, and $h(x)$, if we wanted to verify\n  associativity up to the coefficient of $x^n$, it would be enough\n  to take the first $n+1$ terms of each power series (call these\n  $f_n(x)$, $g_n(x)$, and $h_n(x)$) and verify that\n  \\[\\left[f_n(x)g_n(x)\\right]h_n(x)=f_n(x)\\left[g_n(x)h_n(x)\\right],\\]\n  which follows from associativity for polynomials.  For similar\n  reasons, the constant functions $0$ and $1$ are additive and\n  multiplicative identities, respectively, since they are for\n  polynomials. Additive inverses are similarly straightforward; the\n  additive inverse of a generating function $f(x)$ is just the\n  generating function $-f(x)$.[/li]\n  [li]Suppose that a generating function\n  $f(x)=a_0+a_1x+a_2x^2+\\cdots$ has a multiplicative inverse\n  $g(x)=b_0+b_1x+b_2x^2+\\cdots$, so that $f(x)g(x)=1.$ Since the\n  constant term of $f(x)g(x)$ is $a_0b_0$, we must have $a_0b_0=1$,\n  so that $a_0\\neq 0$ is certainly a necessary condition for $f$ to\n  have a multiplicative inverse. Now, suppose $a_0\\neq 0$.  We know\n  that if a $g(x)$ as above exists, then $b_0$ must equal $1/{a_0}$.\n  Now, suppose we have defined all the $b_i$ for $i<n$.  By matching\n  coefficients of $x^n$, we see that \\[a_0b_n + \\sum_{k=1}^n\n  a_kb_{n-k} = 0,\\] so that $b_n$ is forced to be\n  \\[-\\frac{1}{a_0}\\sum_{k=1}^n a_kb_{n-k}.\\]  Therefore, only one\n  $g(x)$ can be the multiplicative inverse of $f(x)$, and this\n  $g(x)$ works by construction.[/li]\n  [li]Suppose $f(x\\sum a_nx^n$ and $g(x)=\\sum b_nx^n$ are\n  generating functions whose product is $0$, and suppose for a\n  contradiction that both $f$ and $g$ are nonzero.  Then we may let\n  $r$ and $s$ be the minimal indices such that $a_r\\neq 0$ and\n  $b_s\\neq 0$.  By minimality, the coefficient of $x^{r+s}$ in\n  $f(x)g(x)=0$ is equal to $a_rb_s\\neq 0$, and so we have a\n  contradiction.[/li]\n[/ol]\n\nLet us now work through a few examples.\n\n[b]Example 1: Geometric Sequences.[/b]  As we saw above, we would\nlike to say that the geometric sequence $a_n = a_0r^n$ for some\nnumber $r$ gives rise to the generating function\n$f(x)=a_0/(1-rx)$.  What could this mean, in the formal world we\nare assembling?  Well, it would mean that $f(x)(1-rx) = a_0$,\n[i]as power series[/i].  This is easy to verify; $a_0\\cdot 1 =\na_0$, and for $n\\geq 1$ the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product is\njust $a_0r^n - (a_0r^{n-1})\\cdot r = 0$.  Therefore (if $a_0\\neq\n0$) the multiplicative inverse of $f(x)$ is $(1-rx)/a_0$, and we\nmay as well think of $f(x)$ as the "rational function"\n$a_0/(1-rx)$.\n\n[b]Example 2: The Fibonacci Sequence.[/b] Recall the Fibonacci\nsequence, defined as $F_0=1,$ $F_1=1$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n+F_{n-1}$\nfor $n\\geq 1$.  Form the generating function \\[F(x) = F_0 +\nF_1x+F_2x^2+\\cdots =1+x+2x^2+3x^3+5x^4+\\cdots.\\]  Consider the\nexpression $F(x)(1-x-x^2)$.  The first two terms of this product\nare $1+0x+\\cdots$.  For the rest, notice that the coefficient of\n$x^n$ for $n\\geq 2$ is $F_{n}-F_{n-1}-F_{n-2} = 0$, and we find\nthat \\[F(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x-x^2}.\\]  Here is where generating\nfunctions start to become quite useful.  Let us split up this\nrational function in partial fractions.  Let $\\varphi =\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\\bar{\\varphi}=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, so\nthat $1-x-x^2 = (1-\\varphi x)(1-\\bar{\\varphi}x).$  An easy\ncomputation finds that \\[\\frac{x}{1-x-x^2} =\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left(\\frac{\\varphi}{1-\\varphi\nx}-\\frac{\\bar{\\varphi}}{1-\\bar{\\varphi}x}\\right).\\]  Using the facts\nabout geometric sequences from the previous example, we conclude\nthat\n\\[F(x) =\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{\\varphi^{n+1}-\\bar{\\varphi}^{n+1}}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right)\nx^n,\\] so that \\[F_n =\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^{n+1}-\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^{n+1}}{\\sqrt{5}}.\\]\nThus, we get a closed-form formula for the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nNow we introduce a class of generating functions which can prove\nquite useful. Before diving in, notice that we can write the\nbinomial coefficient \\[\\binom{m}{n} =\n\\frac{m(m-1)(m-2)(\\cdots)(m-n+1)}{n!}.\\]  Since this is a\ndegree-$n$ polynomial in $m$, we may actually make sense of the\nexpression $\\binom{x}{n}$ for any (even complex!) number $x$, as\nlong as $n$ remains a nonnegative integer.\n\n[b]Definition 2.[/b] Let $c$ be a complex number.  The generating function $(1+x)^c$ is\ndefined to be \\[(1+x)^c = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\binom{c}{n}x^n =\n1+cx+\\binom{c}{2}x^2+\\cdots.\\]\n\nWe see immediately that $(1+x)^c$ agrees with our usual\ninterpretation of that expression when $c$ is a nonnegative\ninteger.  The following theorem will imply (amongst other things)\nthat this definition is compatible with the notion of $(1+x)^{-1}$\nwe were using above.\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] Let $c$ and $d$ be complex numbers.  Then the following equality\nof generating functions holds: \\[(1+x)^c(1+x)^d = (1+x)^{c+d}.\\]\n\n[b]Proof 2.[/b] Notice that both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the\ndesired expression have polynomials in $c$ and $d$ as coefficients\nof $x^n$; call these polynomials $p_n(c,d)$ and $q_n(c,d)$.  We\nneed only show that $p_n=q_n$.  Suppose $c$ and $d$ are\nnonnegative integers. The expression $(1+x)^c(1+x)^d =\n(1+x)^{c+d}$ holds by the remark above, and so $p_n(c,d)=q_n(c,d)$\nfor any nonnegative integers $c$ and $d$.  Now fix $c$ (still a\nnonnegative integer).  The expression $p_n(c,d)=q_n(c,d)$ holds\nfor infinitely many $d$ (it holds for all nonnegative integers),\nand thus the two polynomials $p_n(c,y)$ and $q_n(c,y)$ must be\nidentical for every nonnegative integer $c$.  Now let $p_{nm}(c)$\nand $q_{nm}(c)$ be the coefficients of $y^m$ in the above\npolynomials; these agree for infinitely many $c$, and thus must be\nidentical polynomials as well.  We conclude that $p_n$ and $q_n$\nmust have been the same polynomials in the first place, and thus\nthat $(1+x)^c(1+x)^d=(1+x)^{c+d}$ for any complex $c$ and $d$.\n\nTherefore, we can raise $1+x$ to negative powers, and also extract\nroots.  Notice that in addition to this, we may understand\n$(1+rx)^c$ as having the coefficient of $x^n$ in $(1+x)^c$\nmultiplied by $r^n$; the same argument gives the same result.\nTherefore, if $(1-x)^{-1}$ is understood as in the definition\nabove, we find that $(1-x)^{-1}(1-x) = 1$, and so the two notions\nwe now have of $(1-x)^{-1}$ coincide (by uniqueness of\ninverses).\n\n[b]Example 3: Polynomial Sequences.[/b] Suppose that $f(x)$ is the\ngenerating function $(1-x)^{-m-1}$, where $m$ is an integer.  We\ncan compute that the coefficient of $x^n$ in this generating\nfunction is\n\\[(-1)^n\\binom{-m-1}{n}=(-1)^n\\frac{(-m-1)(-m-2)(-m-3)\n\\cdots(-m-n)}{n!}=\\binom{n+m}{m}.\\] Therefore, the sequence of\ncoefficients is a sequence of degree-$m$ polynomials in $n$,\nnamely $\\binom{n+m}{m}$.  From these we can obtain all\npolynomials, so these can be used as a basic set of widgets for\nfinding generating functions of polynomial sequences.\n\nAs an example, let us compute the generating function of the\nsequence $a_n=n^2-3n+1.$  We first write the given polynomial in\nterms of binomial coefficients: \\[n^2-3n+1 = 2\\binom{n+2}{2} -\n6\\binom{n+1}{1}+5\\binom{n}{0}.\\]  Thus, the generating function\ncorresponding to this sequence is\n\\[\\frac{2}{(1-x)^3}-\\frac{6}{(1-x)^2}+\\frac{5}{1-x}.\\]  The\ngenerating function of every polynomial can be found in this way,\nand conversely, every rational function whose denominator is a\npower of $1-x$ and whose numerator is of lesser degree (so that it\nbreaks up into fractions alone) is the generating function of a\npolynomial.\n\nHere again, if we replace $1-x$ with $1-rx$, we get the generating\nfunctions of sequences of the form $a_n=p(n)r^n$ where $p(n)$ is a\npolynomial in $n$.  But now we have a method: given a generating\nfunction which is a rational function, we can put it into its\npartial fraction decomposition and see that the sequence it\ncorresponds to is (after a finite amount of time) a sum of\npolynomials multiplied by geometric series.  Furthermore, if the\nrational function is in lowest terms, then the power of $1-rx$ in\nthe denominator is one more than the\ndegree of the polynomial multiplied by $r^n$ in the sequence.\n\n[b]Example 4: Linear Recurrences.[/b]  Suppose we have a linear\nrecurrence, that is a recurrence of the form $a_{n+k} =\nb_1a_{n+k-1}+b_2a_{n+k-2}+\\cdots+b_ka_n,$ where the $b_i$ are\ncomplex numbers and such that we are given (finitely many) initial\nvalues (which include at least) $a_0,\\ldots,a_{k-1}.$ The\nFibonacci sequence is one such.  Let $f(x)$ be the generating\nfunction of the sequence described above. If we look at the\nexpression\n\\[f(x)(1-b_1x-b_2x^2-\\cdots-b_kx^k),\\] we notice that for\nsufficiently large $n$ (say, as soon as we clear the initial\nconditions) the coefficient of $x^n$ is $0$, and so the expression\nis actually a polynomial $p(x)$.  We conclude that \\[f(x) =\n\\frac{p(x)}{1-b_1x-b_2x^2-\\cdots-b_kx^k},\\] and so $f(x)$ is a\nrational function, so that the discussion at the end of Example 3\napplies.  We conclude that we can "read off" the form of a\nlinear recurrence by factoring the polynomial\n$1-b_1x-b_2x^2-\\cdots-b_kx^k$; this is often easier than actually\nfinding $p(x)$ and computing the partial fraction decomposition of\n$f(x)$.\n\n[b]Example 5: The Catalan Numbers.[/b]  Recall the recurrence for\nthe Catalan numbers $(C_n)$:\n\\[C_n=C_{n-1}C_0+C_{n-2}C_1+\\cdots+C_0C_{n-1}.\\]  If we let $C(x)$\nbe the generating function of the Catalan numbers, then this\nrelation gives that \\[C(x) = xC(x)^2+1.\\]  Applying the quadratic\nformula, we obtain that \\[C(x) = \\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}.\\]\nSince the $x$ in the denominator has to cancel an $x$ in the\nnumerator, the constant term of the numerator must be $0$, and we\nsee that the sign must be minus.  Therefore,\n\\[C(x)=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}.\\]  We thus obtain the formula\n\\[C_n = 2(-4)^n\\binom{1/2}{n+1},\\] whose coincidence with the\nusual formula is not hard to show.\n\n[b]Example 6: Partitions.[/b] Let $\\pi(n)$ denote the number of\nunordered partitions of $n$, so that e.g. $\\pi(5)= 7$ because\n$5=4+1=3+2=3+1+1=2+2+1=2+1+1+1=1+1+1+1+1$ is seven partitions of\n5.  This is in general a very difficult sequence to work with, but\nit does have a relatively well-behaved generating function.  Let\n$\\Pi(x)$ be the generating function corresponding to the partition\nsequence.  Let us look at a partition of $n$ as a factorization of\n$x^n$, so that the partition $5=3+1+1$ above corresponds to the\nfactorization $x^5=x^3\\cdot (x^1)^2.$  We thus would like a\ncontribution of exactly 1 to the coefficient of $x^n$ for each\nsequence $k_1,\\ldots,k_r$ with\n\\[(x^1)^{k_1}(x^2)^{k_2}\\cdots(x^r)^{k_r}=x^n.\\]  But this is\naccomplished by the following infinite product:\n\\[\\prod_{k=1}^\\infty(1+x^k+x^{2k}+x^{3k}+\\cdots)=\n\\prod_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{1-x^k}.\\]\n\nBeyond addition and multiplication, there are other operations\nthat we may define on generating functions, namely composition and\nexponentiation, as well as differentiation.  We may also define\npower series in more than one variable, which can be useful (in\nparticular, the generating function solutions to some of the\nproblems at the end require generating functions with multiple\nvariables).  Instead of writing a book, I will merely summarize\nsome facts, most of which can be proven with techniques similar to\nwhat we used above, in addition to the occasional bit of calculus.\n\n[ul][li]Power series in several variables make sense in the same way\n  (and basically for the same reasons) as power series in one\n  variable.  Multiplicative inverses exist if and only if the\n  constant term is nonzero, as before.[/li]\n  [li]Instead of having all exponents in the power series be\n  nonnegative, we may allow a finite number of negative exponents\n  (in each variable).  These are often called [i]meromorphic\n  functions[/i] (as opposed to [i]holomorphic functions[/i], a phrase\n  which refers to power series with all nonnegative exponents). In\n  the world of meromorphic functions, multiplicative inverses exist\n  for [i]all[/i] nonzero functions, as for example $\\frac{1}{x}$ is a\n  meromorphic function.

Also,\n  if we let $g(0)$ denote the constant term of a power series\n  $g(x)$, then for a power series in one variable $f(x)$, \\[ f(x) =\n  \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty \\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!}x^n.\\]  Analogous\n  statements hold in multiple variables.[/li]\n  [li]Define power series in one variable $e^x=\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\n  \\frac{x^n}{n!}$ and $\\log (1+x) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty\n  \\frac{(-1)^{n-1}x^n}{n}$. The usual rules for exponentials and\n  logarithms follow from the usual derivations of these facts in\n  calculus.  Since $e^x$ has a constant term of 1, $\\log(e^x)$ makes\n  sense and is in fact equal to $x$.  The function $e^{\\log (1+x)}$\n  also makes sense (since $\\log(1+x)$ has zero constant term) and is\n  equal to $1+x$. If $c\\in\\mathbb C$, we understand $e^c$ to mean\n  the complex number $e^c$, and then for any power series $f$ we may\n  define $e^{f(x)} = e^{f(0)}e^{f(x)-f(0)}$.  Analogously, if the\n  power series $f(x)$ has a positive real constant term, then we can\n  define \\[ \\log(f(x)) = \\log(f(0)) +\\log\\left(\\frac{f(x)}{f(0)}\\right).\\]\n  Logs and exponentials with other positive real bases can of course\n  also be defined.

In fact, one of these exists if and only if both\n  exist and are equal, and a necessary and sufficient condition for\n  this is that the $x$-coefficient in $f$ is nonzero.

108	[h2]Definition[/h2]\n\nA [i]symmetric function[/i], or [i]symmetric polynomial[/i], is a polynomial $f(x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n)$ which is symmetric in its variables. That is, for any permutation $\\sigma$ of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$, $$f(x_1,\\ldots,x_n)=f(x_{\\sigma(1)},\\ldots,x_{\\sigma(n)}).$$  For instance, the polynomial $f(x,y,z)=3xyz+x^2+y^2+z^2$ is symmetric, but the polynomial $g(x,y,z)=x^2y+y^2z+z^2x$ is not.\n\n[h2]Bases for symmetric functions[/h2]\n\nThere are at least four natural "bases" that generate all symmetric functions: \n[ul][li]Monomial[/li]\n  [li]Elementary[/li]\n  [li]Power Sum[/li]\n  [li]Homogeneous[/li][/ul]\nand it is often useful to write a symmetric polynomial in terms of one of these four types.  Let's explore each of these to see where they arise.\n\n[h3]Monomial symmetric functions[/h3]\n\nIn all of what follows, let $\\lambda=(\\lambda_1,\\lambda_2,\\ldots,\\lambda_k)$  be a sequence of integers written in nonincreasing order.  This can be thought of as a [i]partition[/i] of size $N=\\lambda_1+\\cdots+\\lambda_k$, and we write $|\\lambda|=N$.  Let $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ be some number of variables with $n\\ge k$.\n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] The [b]monomial symmetric function[/b] $m_\\lambda$ in $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ is the smallest symmetric sum of monomials containing $x_1^{\\lambda_1}x_2^{\\lambda_2}\\cdots x_k^{\\lambda_k}$ as a term.\n\n[b]Example 1.[/b] The symmetric function $m_{(3,1,1)}$ in the variables $a,b,c,d$ is $$a^3bc+a^3bd+a^3cd+b^3ac+b^3ad+b^3cd+c^3ab+c^3ad+c^3bd+d^3ab+d^3ac+d^3bc.$$\nThis is also commonly written $$\\sum_{S_{\\{a,b,c,d\\}}}a^3bc$$ or simply $\\sum_{\\text{sym}} a^3bc$ or $\\sum a^3bc$ when the variables are understood.\n\nMonomial symmetric functions are useful because of the following fact:\n"[i][problem]1816[/problem][/i]"  (Prove this!)\n\nBecause of this property, we say that the monomial symmetric functions form a [i]basis[/i] for the space of all symmetric functions.  \n\n[h3]Elementary symmetric functions[/h3]\n\nThe second important basis is the [i]elementary symmetric functions[/i].\n\n[b]Definition 2.[/b] The symmetric function $e_k$ in the variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ is the monomial symmetric function $\\sum x_1x_2\\ldots x_k$.  These functions, along with any product $$e_\\lambda=e_{\\lambda_1}e_{\\lambda_2}\\cdots e_{\\lambda_n}$$ of these, are called the [b]elementary symmetric functions[/b].\n\nYou may recognize $e_k$ as the $k$th coefficient of the polynomial having roots $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$.\n\n[b]Example 2.[/b] In the variables $a,b,c,d$, $$e_{(3,1,1)}=e_3e_1e_1=(abc+abd+acd+bcd)(a+b+c+d)^2.$$\n\nIt is not as obvious, but still true, that \n"[i][problem]1817[/problem][/i]"  (Prove this too!)\n\n[h3]Power sum symmetric functions[/h3]\n\nAnother very important basis is the [i]power sum[/i] symmetric functions.\n\n[b]Definition 3.[/b] The symmetric function $p_r$ in the variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ is the sum $x_1^r+x_2^r+\\cdots+x_n^r$.  These functions, along with any product $$p_\\lambda=p_{\\lambda_1}p_{\\lambda_2}\\cdots p_{\\lambda_n}$$ of these, are called the [b]power sum symmetric functions[/b].\n\n[b]Example 3.[/b] In the variables $a,b,c,d$, $$p_{(3,3,2)}=(a^3+b^3+c^3+d^3)^2(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2).$$\n\nAgain, in this case,\n"[i][problem]1818[/problem][/i]" (Prove this!)\n\n[h3]Homogeneous symmetric functions[/h3]\n\nFinally, we come to the [i]complete homogeneous symmetric functions[/i].  \n\n[b]Definition 4.[/b] The symmetric function $h_d$ in the variables $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ is the sum of all monomials of degree $d$ in these variables.  These functions, along with any product $$h_\\lambda=h_{\\lambda_1}h_{\\lambda_2}\\cdots h_{\\lambda_n}$$ of these, are called the [b](complete) homogeneous symmetric functions[/b].\n\n[b]Example 4.[/b] In the variables $a,b,c,d$, $$h_{(2,1,1)}=h_2h_1^2=(a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+ab+ac+ad+bc+bd+cd)(a+b+c+d)^2.$$\n\nAs you might have guessed by now:\n"[i][problem]1819[/problem][/i]" (Prove it!)\n\n[h2]Transitioning between the bases[/h2]\n\nWe now have defined the four most useful types of symmetric functions: $m_\\lambda$, $e_\\lambda$, $p_\\lambda$, and $h_\\lambda$, and we know we can write any given symmetric function in terms of any of these four bases.  So how do we write them in terms of each other?\n\n[i]Newton's Identities[/i] give us a way of writing the $p$'s in terms of the $e$'s.  They arise from the simple fact that if $p(x)=(x-a_1)(x-a_2)\\cdots (x-a_n)$ is the polynomial with roots $a_1,\\ldots,a_n$, then\n \\begin{eqnarray*}\np(x) &=& x^n-\\left(\\sum_{\\text{sym}} a_1 \\right)x^{n-1}+\\left(\\sum_{\\text{sym}} a_1a_2\\right)x^{n-2}-\\cdots+(-1)^n (a_1\\cdot\\cdots\\cdot a_n) \n    &=& x^n-e_1x^{n-1}+e_2x^{n-2}-\\cdots+(-1)^ne_n\n\\end{eqnarray*} where each $e_k$ is the elementary symmetric function in the roots $a_i$.  Plugging in $x=a_1,\\ldots,x=a_n$ into this equation and summing the results, we find\n\n$$\\sum a_i^n -e_1 \\sum a_i^{n-1}+\\cdots+n\\cdot(-1)^ne_n=0$$ and so $$p_n=e_1p_{n-1}-e_2p_{n-2}+\\cdots+(-1)^{n-1}e_np_0.$$  These equations are called Newton's identities, and they give us a recursive way to compute each $p_i$ in terms of the $e_i$, or vice versa.\n\nGiven the first $n$ of these equations, we can solve for $p_1,\\ldots,p_n$ explicitly, and obtain the following formula using matrices.\n\n[b]Exercise 1.[/b] (If you know a bit of linear algebra.)

112	Let $a,b,m$ be integers.  We say that $a\\equiv b \\bmod m$ ("$a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$") if $m | b-a$ ($m$ divides $b-a$), which is to say that there is some integer $k$ such that $b-a = km$.  We might say that $b$ and $a$ differ by a multiple of $m$.  We almost always assume $m\\neq 0$; what happens if $m=0$?\n\nThe algebra of integers modulo $m$ shares many properties with the algebra of real numbers, but there are a number of things which are considerably different.  Therefore, let us explore what things break and what things do not.  What follows is a list of statements about modular arithmetic, some of which are true, others of which are not so true, but which are all true if we use equality instead of congruence modulo $m$.  If true, let's prove it, and if it is false we should find a counterexample and (if possible) explore to what extent the statement can be adapted to still be true.  Some of these things we won't be able to address properly until later.

113	[h2]Bijections[/h2]\n\nA bijection is simply another way of counting. Let's say we have two sets of objects; then we pair up objects and show that the pairing matches every object from one set with exactly one object in the other set. This is the same as counting on your fingers or even just doing arithmetic.\n\nIf we wanted to show that sets $A$ and $B$ have the same size, then we want to pair up the elements of $A$ to the elements of $B$. For $a\\in A$, let $f(a)$ tell us which element in $B$ that $a$ is paired with. We want to make sure that no two elements of $A$ get sent to the same element of $B$ (also called one-to-one or injective). We also want to make sure that every element of $B$ gets paired with something in $A$ (also called onto or surjective). If our function $f$ is both surjective and injective then it is called a bijection and $A$ and $B$ must have the same size. \n\nNote: Often times the pairing found when solving a bijection doesn't translate into what we are used to when we think of a function $f$. For example, we may be sending arrangements of blocks to other arrangements of blocks by a transformation which is easy to explain in words, but hard to write as a function of blocks.  \n\n[h2]Exercises[/h2]\n[ol]\n[li][problem]1900[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1901[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[h2]Problems[/h2]\n[ol]\n[li][problem]1902[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1903[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1904[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1905[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1906[/problem][/li]\n  [li](St. Petersburg, 1989) [problem]1907[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1908[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Putnam 2003) [problem]1909[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1910[/problem][/li]\n  [li](1983 AIME) [problem]1911[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1912[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1913[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1914[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1915[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	113	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:23:20.841819	2015-08-22 00:23:20.841819	\N

115	Suppose $(a_n)_{n=0}^\\infty$ is a sequence of (complex) numbers.\nWe may form the following (formal) power series: \\[F(x) =\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n x^n.\\]  This is called the [i]generating\nfunction[/i] of the sequence $(a_n)$.\n\nGenerating functions can be a very useful tool for moving between\ncombinatorics and algebra; they often stand in as closed-form\nobjects which represent the result of a recursion, even if that\nrecursion doesn't have a closed-form term-by-term solution.  One\nvalue of generating functions is that they may be added,\nsubtracted, multiplied, and divided (under easy-to-check\nhypotheses); one may raise a positive number to the power of a\ngenerating function, or compose any generating function with\nanother (again, under suitable hypotheses).\n\nOne function which will come up a lot is the following geometric\nseries: \\[a+arx+ar^2x^2+\\cdots = \\frac{a}{1-rx}.\\]  The expression\non the right is how we will want to think of this generating\nfunction (manipulations of this sort are what make generating\nfunctions useful).  The way you may have learned to understand the\nabove equation, however, is in terms of convergent power series on\nan interval of the real line.  This will [i]not[/i] turn out to be\nvery useful for us, at least initially.  In general we want to\nlook at sequences that might not give rise to actual functions\n(like say $a_n = n^n$).  On the other hand, expressions which make\nsense in the world of functions do not necessarily make sense in\nthe world of generating functions.  For example, consider\n$f(x)=1/(1-x)$ as above and $g(x) = 2+x.$  The composition\n$f(g(x))$ (considered purely generatingfunctionologically) would\ntake the form\n\\[1+(2+x)+(2+x)^2+(2+x)^3+\\cdots = (1+2+2^2+\\cdots)+(1+2\\cdot 2+3\\cdot 2^2+\\cdots)x+\n(1+3\\cdot 2+6\\cdot 2^2+\\cdots)x^2 +\\cdots,\\] i.e. nonsense, even\nthough the composition function\n\\[\\frac{1}{1-(2+x)}=-\\frac{1}{1+x} = -1+x-x^2+x^3-\\cdots\\] is\nperfectly sensible as a generating function.\n\nSince these "functions" we have defined are not really\nfunctions, just formal objects, we should define addition and\nmultiplication before we proceed.\n\n[b]Definition 1.[/b] Suppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are two generating functions for\nsequences $(a_n)$ and $(b_n)$ respectively.  Then: [ol] [li][problem]1927[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1928[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\nEven though this is an abstract definition, these are certainly\nthe formulas one would obtain if $f$ and $g$ were actual\nfunctions.  To wit, if you add two absolutely convergent power\nseries together, the coefficients add term-by-term, and if you\nmultiply two such power series then the coefficient of $x^n$ will\nbe the sum over $k$ of the coefficient of $x^k$ in the first times\nthe coefficient of $x^{n-k}$ in the second; such are the ways to\nobtain $x^n$ in the product.\n\nSince, however, we are doing everything formally, we should verify\nthat the rules we are used to working with still hold true here.\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] The following are facts about the arithmetic of generating\nfunctions: [ol] [li][problem]1929[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1930[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1931[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1932[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[b]Proof 1.[/b] [ol] [li][problem]1933[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1934[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1935[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1936[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\nLet us now work through a few examples.\n\n[b]Example 1: Geometric Sequences.[/b]  As we saw above, we would\nlike to say that the geometric sequence $a_n = a_0r^n$ for some\nnumber $r$ gives rise to the generating function\n$f(x)=a_0/(1-rx)$.  What could this mean, in the formal world we\nare assembling?  Well, it would mean that $f(x)(1-rx) = a_0$,\n[i]as power series[/i].  This is easy to verify; $a_0\\cdot 1 =\na_0$, and for $n\\geq 1$ the coefficient of $x^n$ in the product is\njust $a_0r^n - (a_0r^{n-1})\\cdot r = 0$.  Therefore (if $a_0\\neq\n0$) the multiplicative inverse of $f(x)$ is $(1-rx)/a_0$, and we\nmay as well think of $f(x)$ as the "rational function"\n$a_0/(1-rx)$.\n\n[b]Example 2: The Fibonacci Sequence.[/b] Recall the Fibonacci\nsequence, defined as $F_0=1,$ $F_1=1$, and $F_{n+1} = F_n+F_{n-1}$\nfor $n\\geq 1$.  Form the generating function \\[F(x) = F_0 +\nF_1x+F_2x^2+\\cdots =1+x+2x^2+3x^3+5x^4+\\cdots.\\]  Consider the\nexpression $F(x)(1-x-x^2)$.  The first two terms of this product\nare $1+0x+\\cdots$.  For the rest, notice that the coefficient of\n$x^n$ for $n\\geq 2$ is $F_{n}-F_{n-1}-F_{n-2} = 0$, and we find\nthat \\[F(x) = \\frac{1}{1-x-x^2}.\\]  Here is where generating\nfunctions start to become quite useful.  Let us split up this\nrational function in partial fractions.  Let $\\varphi =\n\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}$ and $\\bar{\\varphi}=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}$, so\nthat $1-x-x^2 = (1-\\varphi x)(1-\\bar{\\varphi}x).$  An easy\ncomputation finds that \\[\\frac{x}{1-x-x^2} =\n\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{5}}\\left(\\frac{\\varphi}{1-\\varphi\nx}-\\frac{\\bar{\\varphi}}{1-\\bar{\\varphi}x}\\right).\\]  Using the facts\nabout geometric sequences from the previous example, we conclude\nthat\n\\[F(x) =\n\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\left(\\frac{\\varphi^{n+1}-\\bar{\\varphi}^{n+1}}{\\sqrt{5}}\\right)\nx^n,\\] so that \\[F_n =\n\\frac{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^{n+1}-\\left(\\frac{1-\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^{n+1}}{\\sqrt{5}}.\\]\nThus, we get a closed-form formula for the Fibonacci numbers.\n\nNow we introduce a class of generating functions which can prove\nquite useful. Before delving in, notice that we can write the\nbinomial coefficient \\[\\binom{m}{n} =\n\\frac{m(m-1)(m-2)(\\cdots)(m-n+1)}{n!}.\\]  Since this is a\ndegree-$n$ polynomial in $m$, we may actually make sense of the\nexpression $\\binom{x}{n}$ for any (even complex!) number $x$ (as\nlong as $n$ remains a nonnegative integer).\n\n[b]Definition 2.[/b] Let $c$ be a complex number.  The generating function $(1+x)^c$ is\ndefined to be \\[(1+x)^c = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty\\binom{c}{n}x^n =\n1+cx+\\binom{c}{2}x^2+\\cdots.\\]\n\nWe see immediately that $(1+x)^c$ agrees with our usual\ninterpretation of that expression when $c$ is a nonnegative\ninteger.  The following theorem will imply (amongst other things)\nthat this definition is compatible with the notion of $(1+x)^{-1}$\nwe were using above.\n\n[b]Theorem 2.[/b] Let $c$ and $d$ be complex numbers.  Then the following equality\nof generating functions holds: \\[(1+x)^c(1+x)^d = (1+x)^{c+d}.\\]\n\n[b]Proof 2.[/b] Notice that both the left-hand side and the right-hand side of the\ndesired expression have polynomials in $c$ and $d$ as coefficients\nof $x^n$; call these polynomials $p_n(c,d)$ and $q_n(c,d)$.  We\nneed only show that $p_n=q_n$.  Suppose $c$ and $d$ are\nnonnegative integers. The expression $(1+x)^c(1+x)^d =\n(1+x)^{c+d}$ holds by the remark above, and so $p_n(c,d)=q_n(c,d)$\nfor any nonnegative integers $c$ and $d$.  Now fix $c$ (still a\nnonnegative integer).  The expression $p_n(c,d)=q_n(c,d)$ holds\nfor infinitely many $d$ (it holds for all nonnegative integers),\nand thus the two polynomials $p_n(c,y)$ and $q_n(c,y)$ must be\nidentical for every nonnegative integer $c$.  Now let $p_{nm}(c)$\nand $q_{nm}(c)$ be the coefficients of $y^m$ in the above\npolynomials; these agree for infinitely many $c$, and thus must be\nidentical polynomials as well.  We conclude that $p_n$ and $q_n$\nmust have been the same polynomials in the first place, and thus\nthat $(1+x)^c(1+x)^d=(1+x)^{c+d}$ for any complex $c$ and $d$.\n\nTherefore, we can raise $1+x$ to negative powers, and also extract\nroots.  Notice that in addition to this, we may understand\n$(1+rx)^c$ as having the coefficient of $x^n$ in $(1+x)^c$\nmultiplied by $r^n$; the same argument gives the same result.\nTherefore, if $(1-x)^{-1}$ is understood as in the definition\nabove, we find that $(1-x)^{-1}(1-x) = 1$, and so the two notions\nwe now have of $(1-x)^{-1}$ coincide (by uniqueness of\ninverses).\n\n[b]Example 3: Polynomial Sequences.[/b] Suppose that $f(x)$ is the\ngenerating function $(1-x)^{-m-1}$, where $m$ is an integer.  We\ncan compute that the coefficient of $x^n$ in this generating\nfunction is\n\\[(-1)^n\\binom{-m-1}{n}=(-1)^n\\frac{(-m-1)(-m-2)(-m-3)\n\\cdots(-m-n)}{n!}=\\binom{n+m}{m}.\\] Therefore, the sequence of\ncoefficients is a sequence of degree-$m$ polynomials in $n$,\nnamely $\\binom{n+m}{m}$.  From these we can obtain all\npolynomials, so these can be used as a basic set of widgets for\nfinding generating functions of polynomial sequences.\n\nAs an example, let us compute the generating function of the\nsequence $a_n=n^2-3n+1.$  We first write the given polynomial in\nterms of binomial coefficients: \\[n^2-3n+1 = 2\\binom{n+2}{2} -\n6\\binom{n+1}{1}+5\\binom{n}{0}.\\]  Thus, the generating function\ncorresponding to this sequence is\n\\[\\frac{2}{(1-x)^3}-\\frac{6}{(1-x)^2}+\\frac{5}{1-x}.\\]  The\ngenerating function of every polynomial can be found in this way,\nand conversely, every rational function whose denominator is a\npower of $1-x$ and whose numerator is of lesser degree (so that it\nbreaks up into fractions alone) is the generating function of a\npolynomial.\n\nHere again, if we replace $1-x$ with $1-rx$, we get the generating\nfunctions of sequences of the form $a_n=p(n)r^n$ where $p(n)$ is a\npolynomial in $n$.  But now we have a method: given a generating\nfunction which is a rational function, we can put it into its\npartial fraction decomposition and see that the sequence it\ncorresponds to is (after a finite amount of time) a sum of\npolynomials multiplied by geometric series.  Furthermore, if the\nrational function is in lowest terms, then the power of $1-rx$ in\nthe denominator is one more than the\ndegree of the polynomial multiplied by $r^n$ in the sequence.\n\n[b]Example 4: Linear Recurrences.[/b]  Suppose we have a linear\nrecurrence, that is a recurrence of the form $a_{n+k} =\nb_1a_{n+k-1}+b_2a_{n+k-2}+\\cdots+b_ka_n,$ where the $b_i$ are\ncomplex numbers and such that we are given (finitely many) initial\nvalues (which include at least) $a_0,\\ldots,a_{k-1}.$ The\nFibonacci sequence is one such.  Let $f(x)$ be the generating\nfunction of the sequence described above. If we look at the\nexpression\n\\[f(x)(1-b_1x-b_2x^2-\\cdots-b_kx^k),\\] we notice that for\nsufficiently large $n$ (say, as soon as we clear the initial\nconditions) the coefficient of $x^n$ is $0$, and so the expression\nis actually a polynomial $p(x)$.  We conclude that \\[f(x) =\n\\frac{p(x)}{1-b_1x-b_2x^2-\\cdots-b_kx^k},\\] and so $f(x)$ is a\nrational function, so that the discussion at the end of Example 3\napplies.  We conclude that we can "read off" the form of a\nlinear recurrence by factoring the polynomial\n$1-b_1x-b_2x^2-\\cdots-b_kx^k$; this is often easier than actually\nfinding $p(x)$ and computing the partial fraction decomposition of\n$f(x)$.\n\n[b]Example 5: Catalan Numbers.[/b]  Recall the recurrence for the\nCatalan numbers $(C_n)$:\n\\[C_n=C_{n-1}C_0+C_{n-2}C_1+\\cdots+C_0C_{n-1}.\\]  If we let $C(x)$\nbe the generating function of the Catalan numbers, then this\nrelation gives that \\[C(x) = xC(x)^2+1.\\]  Applying the quadratic\nformula, we obtain that \\[C(x) = \\frac{1\\pm\\sqrt{1-4x}}{x}.\\]\nSince the $x$ in the denominator has to cancel an $x$ in the\nnumerator, the constant term of the numerator must be $0$, and we\nsee that the sign must be minus.  Therefore,\n\\[C(x)=\\frac{1-\\sqrt{1-4x}}{2x}.\\]  We thus obtain the formula\n\\[C_n = 2(-4)^n\\binom{1/2}{n+1},\\] whose coincidence with the\nusual formula is not hard to show.\n\n[b]Example 6: Partitions.[/b] Let $\\pi(n)$ denote the number of\nunordered partitions of $n$, so that e.g. $\\pi(5)= 7$ because\n$5=4+1=3+2=3+1+1=2+2+1=2+1+1+1=1+1+1+1+1$ is seven partitions of\n5.  This is in general a very difficult sequence to work with, but\nit does have a relatively well-behaved generating function.  Let\n$\\Pi(x)$ be the generating function corresponding to the partition\nsequence.  Let us look at a partition of $n$ as a factorization of\n$x^n$, so that the partition $5=3+1+1$ above corresponds to the\nfactorization $x^5=x^3\\cdot (x^1)^2.$  We thus would like a\ncontribution of exactly 1 to the coefficient of $x^n$ for each\nsequence $k_1,\\ldots,k_r$ with\n\\[(x^1)^{k_1}(x^2)^{k_2}\\cdots(x^r)^{k_r}=x^n.\\]  But this is\naccomplished by the following infinite product:\n\\[\\prod_{k=1}^\\infty(1+x^k+x^{2k}+x^{3k}+\\cdots)=\n\\prod_{k=1}^\\infty\\frac{1}{1-x^k}.\\]\n\nBeyond addition and multiplication, there are other operations\nthat we may define on generating functions, namely composition and\nexponentiation, as well as differentiation.  These, however, are a\ntopic for another handout.\n\n\n[b]Exercises and Problems[/b]\n\n[ol]\n  \n  [li][problem]1937[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1938[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1939[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Cauchy's Identity) [problem]1940[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]1941[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Euler's Pentagonal Numbers Theorem) [problem]1942[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	115	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:23:23.064984	2015-08-22 00:23:23.064984	\N

Then there is a circle with center in $L$ that passes through $B$, $C$, $I$ and $I_a$. Notice that this means that $LB = LC = LI = LI_a$ and, moreover, $L$ is the midpoint of $II_a$.\n\nThere is a number of ways of interpreting this fact:\n[ol]\n  [li][problem]2020[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2021[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]\n\n[b]Fact 6.[/b] (Internal, external, perpendicular bisectors) Let $ABC$ be a triangle.

123	Inclusion-Exclusion can be a useful method for counting\nthe union of a collection of prescribed sets.  Suppose we are\ngiven a bunch of finite sets $S_1,S_2,\\ldots, S_n$.  A first\napproximation to the number of elements of $S_1\\cup S_2\\cup\n\\cdots\\cup S_n$ might be $$|S_1\\cup S_2\\cup \\cdots\\cup S_n| =\n|S_1|+ |S_2|+ \\cdots+ |S_n|.$$  This of course does not work in\ngeneral: the $S_i$ might overlap.  So as a second approximation,\nwe might subtract off the sizes of all the pairwise intersections\n$S_i\\cap S_j$, $i\\neq j$.  Now we are undercounting the elements\nwhich occur in three of the sets, so we add those back, etc.\n\nPursuant of a systematic approach to all this, we formulate a\ntheorem.\n\n[b]Theorem 1.[/b] (Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion)  Let $S_1,\\ldots, S_n$ be a\ncollection of $n$ finite sets.  Then: $\\begin{equation} |S_1\\cup\nS_2\\cup\\cdots\\cup S_n| = \\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq n} |S_i| - \\sum_{1\\leq\ni < j\\leq n} |S_i \\cap S_j|\\nonumber  + \\sum_{1\\leq i< j < k\\leq\nn} |S_i\\cap S_j\\cap S_k| - \\cdots + (-1)^{n-1}|S_1\\cap\nS_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap S_n|. \\nonumber\\end{equation}$\n\n[b]Proof 1.[/b] We need to check that each element of the union of the $S_i$ is\ncounted only once on the right-hand side.  Suppose, then, that $x$\nis an element of the union, and let $k\\geq 1$ be the number of\nsets in the collection in which $x$ appears.  The first summation\nwill count $x$ a number of times equal to $k$; once for each set\nin which $x$ appears.  The second sum will count $x$ once for\nevery pair of sets with $x$ appearing in both; there are\n$\\binom{k}{2}$ of those.  Similarly, the third summation counts\n$\\binom{k}{3}$, and the $j^{\\mathrm {th}}$ counts $\\binom{k}{j}$.  Therefore,\nthe total number of times $x$ is counted is \\[\\binom{k}{1} -\n\\binom{k}{2} + \\binom{k}{3} - \\cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\\binom{k}{k} =\n1-(1-1)^k = 1.\\]  Each element is thus counted 1 time on the\nright-hand side, and we are done.\n\nNotice that it follows from the argument that if we sum up to the\n$r^{\\mathrm {th}}$ term of the Inclusion-Exclusion formula, then we will be\nequal to or over the final count if $r$ is odd and equal to or\nunder if $r$ is even.  This follows from the fact that\n\\[\\binom{k}{1}-\\binom{k}{2}+\\binom{k}{3}-\\cdots+(-1)^{r-1}\\binom{k}{r}\n= 1 + (-1)^{r-1}\\binom{k-1}{r}.\\]  These facts (I think) are known\nas \\emph {Bonferonni's Inequalities.}\n\nThe statement of this theorem may look a bit intimidating, but it\nis actually quite simple.  For example, the case $n=3$ gives \\[\n|R\\cup S\\cup T| = |R| + |S| + |T| - |R\\cap S| - |R\\cap T| - |S\\cap\nT| + |R\\cap S\\cap T|.\\]  Putting this into practice, suppose\n$R=\\{a,b,c,d,e\\}$, $S=\\{b,c,e,f\\}$, and $T=\\{a,c,f,g\\}$.  Then we\nconclude that \\[|R\\cup S\\cup T| = 5+4+4 - 3-2-2+1 = 7.\\]\n\nInclusion-Exclusion is often known in the following (equivalent\nbut) different form:\n\n[b]Corollary 1.[/b] Let $S_1\\ldots,S_n$ be subsets of a set $X$, and let $S_i^c$\ndenote the complement of $S_i$ in $X$.  Then $\\begin{equation} |S_1^c\\cap\nS_2^c\\cap\\cdots \\cap S_n^c| = |X| - \\sum_{1\\leq i\\leq n} |S_i| +\n\\sum_{1\\leq i < j\\leq n} |S_i \\cap S_j|\\nonumber  - \\sum_{1\\leq\ni< j < k\\leq n} |S_i\\cap S_j\\cap S_k| + \\cdots + (-1)^n|S_1\\cap\nS_2\\cap\\cdots\\cap S_n|. \\nonumber\\end{equation}$\n\n[b]Proof 2.[/b] This follows from Inclusion-Exclusion upon observing that\n\\[S_1^c\\cap S_2^c\\cap\\cdots \\cap S_n^c = \\left( S_1\\cup S_2\\cup\\cdots\\cup\nS_n\\right)^c.\\]\n\nThis form has a particularly elegant version.  Fix a finite set\n$X$, and for any $\\mathcal C$ a finite (possibly empty) collection\nof subsets of $X$, let $\\bigcap \\mathcal C$ be the intersection of\nall elements of $\\mathcal C$, or $X$ if $\\mathcal C$ is empty.\nThen: \\[\\left|\\bigcap_{S\\in\\mathcal C}S^c\\right| = \\sum_{\\mathcal\nU\\subseteq\\mathcal C} (-1)^{|\\mathcal U|}\\left|\\bigcap\\mathcal\nU\\right|.\\]\n\n Let us look at some examples of inclusion-exclusion in\naction.\n\n [b]Example 1.[/b] Determine the number of primes less or\nequal to 111.\n\n [b]Example 2.[/b][AIME 2001] Each unit square of a\n3-by-3 unit-square grid is to be colored either blue or red. For\neach square, either color is equally likely. What is the\nprobability of obtaining a grid that does not have a 2-by-2 red\nsquare?\n\n [b]Example 3.[/b]  Let $n$ be a positive integer.

124	This handout is cribbed almost verbatim from a Kiran handout from\n1996.  We start with a bunch of definitions.\n\n[ul][li]A [i]graph[/i] is a pair $(V, E)$, where $V$ is a finite set and\n  $E$ is a set of unordered pairs of elements of $V$. The elements\n  of $V$ and $E$ are called [i]vertices[/i] and [i]edges[/i],\n  respectively.[/li]\n  [li]A [i]directed graph (digraph)[/i] is the same as a graph,\n  except that the edges are now ordered pairs of distinct vertices.\n  (An edge is said to "come out of" the first vertex in the pair\n  and "go into" the second vertex.) When we say "graph", we mean\n  an undirected graph unless otherwise specified.[/li]\n  [li]An [i]isomorphism[/i] of two (directed or undirected) graphs is a\n  bijection of their vertices such that two vertices of one graph\n  form an edge if and only if their images form an edge (if the\n  graphs are directed, the bijection must preserve orientation as\n  well).[/li]\n  [li]Two vertices are [i]adjacent[/i] if they are the endpoints of\n  an edge.[/li]\n  [li]The [i]degree[/i] of a vertex is the number of edges it is an\n  endpoint of. In a directed graph, the [i]in-degree[/i] and {\\em\n  out-degree} of a vertex are the number of edges coming in and\n  going out of, respectively, that vertex. A graph is {\\em\n  $k$-regular} if every vertex has degree $k$.[/li]\n  [li]A graph is [i]connected[/i] if one cannot separate the vertices\n  into two groups, such that every edge connects two vertices in the\n  same group. Otherwise it is [i]disconnected[/i].[/li]\n  [li]A [i]$k$-coloring[/i] of a graph is a partition of the vertex\n  set into $k$ subsets, such that no two vertices in the same subset\n  are adjacent. A [i]$k$-edge-coloring[/i] is a partition of the edge\n  set into $k$ subsets, such that no two edges in the same subset\n  have a common endpoint. A $2$-colorable graph is also said to be\n  [i]bipartite[/i].[/li]\n  [li]The [i]complete[/i] graph $K_n$ is the graph on $n$ vertices in\n  which every pair of vertices is an edge. The [i]complete\n  bipartite[/i] graph $K_{m,n}$ is the graph on $m+n$ vertices in which\n  every pair of vertices, one from the first $m$ and one from the\n  other $n$, is an edge. Similarly, the [i]complete multipartite[/i]\n  graph $K_{m_1, \\dots, m_k}$ is the graph on $m_1 + \\cdots + m_k$\n  vertices, containing every pair of vertices in distinct partitions\n  as an edge.[/li]\n  [li]A [i]planar[/i] graph is one that can be drawn in the plane,\n  with points representing the vertices, and (polygonal) curves\n  representing the edges, so that no two edges meet except at a\n  common endpoint. The regions into which the edges divide the plane\n  are called [i]faces[/i].[/li]\n  [li]A [i]path[/i] is a sequence of distinct vertices such that\n  every two consecutive vertices are adjacent. A [i]cycle[/i] is the\n  same except that the first and last vertices are equal.  In a\n  directed graph, paths usually travel in the direction of the edge\n  orientations.[/li]\n  [li]An [i]Eulerian tour[/i] is a path (but repeated vertices\n  allowed) containing each edge exactly once.[/li]\n  [li]A [i]Hamiltonian path/cycle[/i] is a path/cycle containing each\n  vertex exactly once.[/li][/ul]\n\n\n[b]Some Hard Theorems[/b]\n\n[ul][li](Marriage theorem) Let $A,B$ be the color sets in a 2-coloring\n  of a bipartite graph. We wish to choose a set of edges such that\n  every vertex of $A$ lies on exactly one of the edges, but no\n  vertex of $B$ lies no more than one. This is possible if and only\n  if, for all $S \\subseteq A$, the set of vertices adjacent to at\n  least one vertex of $S$ contains at least as many elements as $S$.[/li]\n  [li](Four-color theorem) Every planar graph is 4-colorable.[/li]\n  [li](Cayley's formula) The number of trees on $n$ labeled vertices\n  is $n^{n-2}$.[/li]\n  [li](Turan's theorem) The maximum number of edges in a graph on\n  $n$ vertices containing no $K_{k+1}$ occurs for the complete\n  $k$-partite graph $K_{m_1, \\dots, m_k}$, where $m_1 + \\cdots + m_k\n  = n$ and no two of the $m_i$ differ by more than 1.[/li][/ul]\n\n\n[b]Exercises and Problems[/b]\n\n\n[ol]\n  \n  [li](Handshake lemma) [problem]2072[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2073[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2074[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2075[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2076[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2077[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2078[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Euler's formula) [problem]2079[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2080[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2081[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1981/2) [problem]2082[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1989/2) [problem]2083[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2084[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1991/4) [problem]2085[/problem][/li]\n  [li][problem]2086[/problem][/li]\n  [li](Pamphlet, Russia 15) [problem]2087[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1995/5, and pamphlet, USA 5) [problem]2088[/problem][/li]\n  [li](USAMO 1986/2) [problem]2089[/problem][/li]\n  [li](IMO 1992/3) [problem]2090[/problem][/li]\n[/ol]	124	Explanation	2015-08-22 00:23:36.969741	2015-08-22 00:23:36.969741	\N

1	--- []\n	2	2015-08-22 00:20:26.820267	2015-08-22 00:20:26.820267	Suppose the first condition is true. Setting $x_i = 1$ for each $i$ gives $\\sum a_i \\leq \\sum b_i$, and similarly setting $x_i = -1$ for each $i$ gives $\\sum a_i \\geq \\sum b_i$, so the sums are equal. Next, for each $k$, setting $x_1 = \\cdots + x_k = -1, x_{k+1} = \\cdots = x_n = 0$ shows that $a_1 + \\cdots + a_k \\geq b_1 + \\cdots + b_k$ for each $k$, which is exactly the condition in (ii). \n\nNow suppose (ii) holds, and take any sequence $x_1 \\leq \\cdots \\leq x_n$. Define $A_k = a_1 + a_2 + \\cdots + a_k$ and $B_k = b_1 + b_2 + \\cdots + b_k$. By Abel Summation, we have\n\n$\\begin{align*}\na_1 x_2 + \\cdots + a_n x_n \n&= A(x_1 - x_2) + A_2(x_2 - x_3) + \\cdots + A_{n-1}(x_{n-1} - x_n) + A_nx_n \\\\\n&\\geq B_1(x_1 - x_2) + B_2(x_2 - x_3) + \\cdots + B_{n-1}(x_{n-1} - x_n) + B_n x_n \\tag{3} \\\\\n&= b_1 x_1 + \\cdots + b_n x_n,\n\\end{align*}$\n\nwhere line (3) follows because $x_i - x_{i+1} \\leq 0$ and $A_n = B_n$. This shows (i), and we're done. $\\square$  	1

The $2^k - 1$ nonempty subsets of $\\{a_1, \\ldots, a_k\\}$ have all different sums, so $a_1 + \\cdots + a_k \\geq 2^k - 1$ for each $k$. If we set $y_k = 2^{k-1}$, this reads  \n\\[ a_1 + \\cdots + a_k \\geq y_1 + \\cdots + y_k. \\]  \n\nAlso, we clearly have $a_1 y_1 < a_2 y_2 < \\cdots < a_n y_n$, since both sequences strictly increase. Thus, by part (a), we have  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{a_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{a_n} \\leq \\frac{1}{y_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{y_n} = 2 - \\frac{1}{2^{n-1}} < 2, \\]  \nas desired. $\\square$	1
3	--- []\n	4	2015-08-22 00:20:27.08787	2015-08-22 00:20:27.08787	First, notice that $\\frac{1}{u_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{u_n} = 1 - \\frac{1}{u_1 \\cdots u_n}$. Since $\\frac{1}{x_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{x_n}$ can be expressed as a fraction with denominator at most $x_1 \\cdots x_n$, if $x_1 \\cdots x_n < u_1 \\cdots u_n$, then inequality (4) must hold. So suppose that $x_1 \\cdots x_n \\geq u_1 \\cdots u_n$.  \n\nThe proof is by induction. The base case is clear, as $x_1 \\geq u_1 = 2$. Now, we'd like to prove $\\frac{1}{x_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{x_n} \\leq \\frac{1}{u_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{u_n}$. By hypothesis we know that $\\frac{1}{x_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{x_{n-1}} \\leq \\frac{1}{u_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{u_{n-1}}$, so if we knew that $x_n \\geq u_n$, the result would follow. Unfortunately, we don't know much about the size of $x_n$, so this fails.  \n\nWhat if we pull off the terms $x_{\\ell}, x_{\\ell + 1}, \\ldots, x_n$ instead of just $x_n$, for some $\\ell$? If we could show that $\\frac{1}{x_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{x_n} \\leq \\frac{1}{u_{\\ell}} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{u_n}$, the result would follow by adding this to the inductive hypothesis applied to index $\\ell - 1$. The same problem that the $x_i$'s may be much smaller than the $u_i$'s might occur, but this would seem to go against the assumption that $x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n \\geq u_1 u_2 \\cdots u_n$. This idea is what saves us.  \n\nLet $\\ell$ be the largest index $j$ so that $x_j \\cdot x_{j+1} \\cdots x_n \\geq u_j \\cdot u_{j+1} \\cdots u_n$. This implies  \n\\[ x_{\\ell} \\geq u_{\\ell}, x_{\\ell} x_{\\ell + 1} \\geq u_{\\ell} u_{\\ell + 1}, x_{\\ell} x_{\\ell + 1} x_{\\ell + 2} \\geq u_{\\ell} u_{\\ell + 1} u_{\\ell + 2}, \\]  \netc., because otherwise we could increase $\\ell$. It turns out that these inequalities alone are enough to prove that  \n\\[ \\frac{1}{x_{\\ell}} + \\frac{1}{x_{\\ell + 1}} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{x_n} \\leq \\frac{1}{u_{\\ell}} + \\frac{1}{u_{\\ell + 1}} + \\cdots + \\frac{1}{u_n}, \\]\nwhich lets us finish by induction as mentioned. We'll show this fact in the following form (which is equivalent to the original by taking reciprocals):  \n\n\n[b]Lemma 1.[/b] If $p_1 \\geq p_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq p_n$, and $q_1 \\geq q_2 \\geq \\cdots \\geq q_n$, are two decreasing sequences of positive numbers and if $p_! p_2 \\cdots p_k \\leq q_1 q_2 \\cdots q_k$ for each $1 \\leq k \\leq n$, then $p_1 + \\cdots + p_n \\leq q_1 + \\cdots + q_n$.  \n\n\n[i]Proof.[/i] We can use Abel summation in the following way (why would we think to use Abel Summation?):  \n\n$\\begin{align*}\nq_1 + \\cdots + q_n\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^n p_k \\cdot \\frac{q_k}{p_k} \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^n (p_k - p_{k+1}) \\left( \\frac{q_1}{p_1} + \\cdots + \\frac{q_k}{p_k} \\right) \\\\\n&\\geq \\sum_{k=1}^n (p_k - p_{k+1}) \\cdot k \\sqrt[k]{\\frac{q_1 \\cdot q_k}{p_1 \\cdot p_k}} \\\\\n&\\geq \\sum_{k=1}^n (p_k - p_{k+1}) \\cdot k \\\\\n&= \\sum_{k=1}^n p_k, \n\\end{align*}$  \n\nwhere we use the convention $p_{n+1} = 0$. This is the desired inequality. $\\square$  	1
4	--- []\n	5	2015-08-22 00:20:27.188606	2015-08-22 00:20:27.188606	After playing at the series for a while, one of the difficulties that seems to arise is the existence of two types of terms: the early ones where $\\sin kx$ influences the sum more than the denominator, and the later ones where the $\\frac{1}{k}$ takes over. So, a natural idea is to split the sum into two parts, namely  \n\\[ \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{\\sin kx}{k} \\text{ and } \\sum_{k=m+1}^n \\frac{\\sin kx}{k}, \\]  \nfor some index $m$ yet to be determined.  \n\nConsider the first of these sums. These are the ones where the sin terms seem to dominate. So assuming WLOG that $0 \\leq x < \\pi$ (in fact $0 < x < \\pi$, as the $x=0$ case is easy), we can use the inequality $\\sin t \\leq t$ to (perhaps somewhat stupidly) form the bound  \n\\[  \\left | \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{\\sin kx}{k} \\right | \\leq \\sum_{k=1}^m \\frac{kx}{x} = mx. \\]  \n\nLet's be a bit more clever for the second of the sums. Recall that these are the terms where we consider the denominators more influential, so we'd like to do something simple like simply say $\\sin t \\leq 1$ and then let the $k$'s in the denominator carry the rest. While this doesn't quite work in its current form (the harmonic series diverges), we can use Abel Summation to rewrite the sum as follows: \n\\[ \\sum_{k=m+1}^n \\frac{\\sin kx}{x} = \\frac{1}{n} S_n + \\sum_{k=m+1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{n(n+1)} S_k, \\tag{5} \\]  \nwhere $S_k = \\sin((m+1)x) + \\cdots + \\sin(kx)$. But notice that we can make each $S_k$ telescope as follows: \n\n\\[ S_k = \\sum_{t=m+1} \\sin(tx) = \\sum_{t=m+1}^k \\frac{1}{\\sin \\frac{x}{2}} \\left( \\cos \\left( t + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) x) - \\cos \\left(t - \\frac{1}{2} \\right)x \\right) = \\frac{1}{2 \\sin \\frac{x}{2}} \\left( \\cos \\left(n + \\frac{1}{2} \\right)x - \\cos \\left(m + \\frac{1}{2} \\right) x \\right). \\]  \n\n[i]Now[/i] we can use the $|\\sin t| \\leq 1$ bound: we find $|S_k| \\leq \\frac{2}{2 \\sin \\frac{x}{2}} = \\frac{1}{2 \\sin \\frac{x}{2}}$, and so (5) produces the following:  \n\\[  \\left | \\sum_{k=m+1}^n \\frac{\\sin kx}{k} \\right | \\leq \\frac{1}{\\sin \\frac{x}{2}} \\cdot \\left( \\frac{1}{n} + \\sum_{k=m+1}^{n-1} \\frac{1}{k} - \\frac{1}{k+1} \\right) = \\frac{1}{(m+1) \\sin \\frac{x}{2}}. \\] \nSo we have the bound $mx + \\frac{1}{(m+1) \\sin \\frac{x}{2}}$ on the given sum, where $m$ is some integer that has not yet been chosen. As this expression is probably minimized when both terms are equal, perhaps we should try to show each term is bounded by $\\sqrt{\\pi}$, i.e., we should try choosing $m = \\lfloor \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{x} \\rfloor$. Then $m + 1 > \\frac{\\sqrt{\\pi}}{x}$, so we would need $\\sin \\frac{x}{2} \\geq \\frac{x}{\\pi}$. But this is indeed true, as the line $y = \\frac{2x}{\\pi}$ connecting $(0, \\sin 0) = (0,0)$ with $(\\frac{\\pi}{2}, \\sin \\frac{\\pi}{2}) = (\\frac{\\pi}{2}, 1)$ lies below the curve $y = \\sin x$ on the interval $[0, \\frac{\\pi}{2}]$ (since $\\sin$ is concave down here). $\\square$  	1
